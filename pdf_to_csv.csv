he Great War had brought Paul Lewis into the navy in 1918 
as a lieutenant commander, but he never seemed quite at ease when 
in his uniform. It never seemed to ﬁt quite right, or to sit quite right, 
and he was often ﬂustered and failed to respond properly when sailors 
saluted him. 
Yet he was every bit a warrior, and he hunted death. 
When he found it he confronted it, challenged it, tried to pin it in 
place like a lepidopterist pinning down a butterﬂy, so he could then dis-
sect it piece by piece, analyze it, and ﬁnd a way to confound it. He did so 
often enough that the risks he took became routine. 
Still, death had never appeared to him as it did now, in mid-September 
1918. Row after row of men confronted him in the hospital ward, many 
of them bloody and dying in some new and awful way. 
He had been called here to solve a mystery that dumbfounded the cli-
nicians. For Lewis was a scientist. Although a physician he had never 
practiced on a patient. Instead, a member of the very ﬁrst generation of 
American medical scientists, he had spent his life in the laboratory. He 
had already built an extraordinary career, an international reputation, 
and he was still young enough to be seen as just coming into his prime. 
A decade earlier, working with his mentor at the Rockefeller Institute 
in New York City, he had proved that a virus caused polio, a discovery still 
considered a landmark achievement in the history of virology. He had 
"

then developed a vaccine that protected monkeys from polio with nearly 
100 percent effectiveness. 
That and other successes had won him the position of founding head 
of the Henry Phipps Institute, a research institute associated with the 
University of Pennsylvania, and in 1917 he had been chosen for the great 
honor of giving the annual Harvey Lecture. It seemed only the ﬁrst of 
many honors that would come his way. Today, the children of two promi-
nent scientists who knew him then and who crossed paths with many 
Nobel laureates say their fathers each told them that Lewis was the 
smartest man they had ever met. 
The clinicians now looked to him to explain the violent symptoms 
these sailors presented. The blood that covered so many of them did not 
come from wounds, at least not from steel or explosives that had torn 
away limbs. Most of the blood had come from nosebleeds. A few sailors 
had coughed the blood up. Others had bled from their ears. Some 
coughed so hard that autopsies would later show they had torn apart 
abdominal muscles and rib cartilage. And many of the men writhed in 
agony or delirium; nearly all those able to communicate complained of 
headache, as if someone were hammering a wedge into their skulls just 
behind the eyes, and body aches so intense they felt like bones breaking. 
A few were vomiting. Finally the skin of some of the sailors had turned 
unusual colors; some showed just a tinge of blue around their lips or ﬁnger-
tips, but a few looked so dark one could not tell easily if they were Cau-
casian or Negro. They looked almost black. 
Only once had Lewis seen a disease that in any way resembled this. 
Two months earlier, members of the crew of a British ship had been taken 
by ambulance from a sealed dock to another Philadelphia hospital and 
placed in isolation. There many of that crew had died. At autopsy their 
lungs had resembled those of men who had died from poison gas or 
pneumonic plague, a more virulent form of bubonic plague. 
Whatever those crewmen had had, it had not spread. No one else had 
gotten sick. 
But the men in the wards now not only puzzled Lewis. They had to 
have chilled him with fear also, fear both for himself and and for what 
this disease could do. For whatever was attacking these sailors was not 
only spreading, it was spreading explosively. 
And it was spreading despite a well-planned, concerted effort to con-
"

Prologue 
tain it. This same disease had erupted ten days earlier at a navy facility in 
Boston. Lieutenant Commander Milton Rosenau at the Chelsea Naval 
Hospital there had certainly communicated to Lewis, whom he knew 
well, about it. Rosenau too was a scientist who had chosen to leave a Har-
vard professorship for the navy when the United States entered the war, 
and his textbook on public health was called “The Bible” by both army 
and navy military doctors. 
Philadelphia navy authorities had taken Rosenau’s warnings seriously, 
especially since a detachment of sailors had just arrived from Boston, and 
they had made preparations to isolate any ill sailors should an outbreak 
occur. They had been conﬁdent that isolation would control it. 
Yet four days after that Boston detachment arrived, nineteen sailors in 
Philadelphia were hospitalized with what looked like the same disease. 
Despite their immediate isolation and that of everyone with whom they 
had had contact, eighty-seven sailors were hospitalized the next day. 
They and their contacts were again isolated. But two days later, six hun-
dred men were hospitalized with this strange disease. The hospital ran 
out of empty beds, and hospital staff began falling ill. The navy then be-
gan sending hundreds more sick sailors to a civilian hospital. And sailors 
and civilian workers were moving constantly between the city and navy 
facilities, as they had in Boston. Meanwhile, personnel from Boston, and 
now Philadelphia, had been and were being sent throughout the country 
as well. 
That had to chill Lewis, too. 
Lewis had visited the ﬁrst patients, taken blood, urine, and sputum 
samples, done nasal washings, and swabbed their throats. Then he had 
come back again to repeat the process of collecting samples and to study 
the symptoms for any further clues. In his laboratory he and everyone 
under him poured their energies into growing and identifying whatever 
pathogen was making the men sick. He needed to ﬁnd the pathogen. He 
needed to ﬁnd the cause of the disease. And even more he needed to 
make a curative serum or a preventive vaccine. 
Lewis loved the laboratory more than he loved anyone or anything. 
His work space was crammed; it looked like a thicket of icicles—test 
tubes in racks, stacked petri dishes, pipettes—but it warmed him, gave 
him as much and perhaps more comfort than did his home and family. 
But he did not love working like this. The pressure to ﬁnd an answer did 
"

The Great Influenza 
not bother him; much of his polio research had been conducted in the 
midst of an epidemic so extreme that New York City had required people 
to obtain passes to travel. What did bother him was the need to abandon 
good science. To succeed in preparing either a vaccine or serum, he would 
have to make a series of guesses based on at best inconclusive results, and 
each guess would have to be right. 
He had already made one guess. If he did not yet know precisely what 
caused the disease, nor how or whether he could prevent it or cure it, he 
believed he knew what the disease was. 
He believed it was inﬂuenza, although an inﬂuenza unlike any known 
before. 
Lewis was correct. In 1918 an inﬂuenza virus emerged—probably in the 
United States—that would spread around the world, and one of its earli-
est appearances in lethal form came in Philadelphia. Before that world-
wide pandemic faded away in 1920, it would kill more people than any 
other outbreak of disease in human history. Plague in the 1300s killed a far 
larger proportion of the population—more than one-quarter of Europe— 
but in raw numbers inﬂuenza killed more than plague then, more than 
AIDS today. 
The lowest estimate of the pandemic’s worldwide death toll is twenty-
one million, in a world with a population less than one-third today’s. 
That estimate comes from a contemporary study of the disease and 
newspapers have often cited it since, but it is almost certainly wrong. Epi-
demiologists today estimate that inﬂuenza likely caused at least ﬁfty mil-
lion deaths worldwide, and possibly as many as one hundred million. 
Yet even that number understates the horror of the disease, a horror 
contained in other data. Normally inﬂuenza chieﬂy kills the elderly and 
infants, but in the 1918 pandemic roughly half of those who died were 
young men and women in the prime of their life, in their twenties and 
thirties. Harvey Cushing, then a brilliant young surgeon who would go 
on to great fame—and who himself fell desperately ill with inﬂuenza and 
never fully recovered from what was likely a complication—would call 
these victims “doubly dead in that they died so young.” 
One cannot know with certainty, but if the upper estimate of the 
death toll is true as many as 8 to 10 percent of all young adults then liv-
ing may have been killed by the virus. 
"
"5 
Prologue 
And they died with extraordinary ferocity and speed. Although the 
inﬂuenza pandemic stretched over two years, perhaps two-thirds of the 
deaths occurred in a period of twenty-four weeks, and more than half of 
those deaths occurred in even less time, from mid-September to early 
December 1918. Inﬂuenza killed more people in a year than the Black 
Death of the Middle Ages killed in a century; it killed more people in 
twenty-four weeks than AIDS has killed in twenty-four years. 
The inﬂuenza pandemic resembled both of those scourges in other 
ways also. Like AIDS, it killed those with the most to live for. And as 
priests had done in the bubonic plague, in 1918, even in Philadelphia, as 
modern a city as existed in the world, priests would drive horse-drawn 
wagons down the streets, calling upon those behind doors shut tight in 
terror to bring out their dead. 
Yet the story of the 1918 inﬂuenza virus is not simply one of havoc, death, 
and desolation, of a society ﬁghting a war against nature superimposed 
on a war against another human society. 
It is also a story of science, of discovery, of how one thinks, and of how 
one changes the way one thinks, of how amidst near-utter chaos a few 
men sought the coolness of contemplation, the utter calm that precedes 
not philosophizing but grim, determined action. 
For the inﬂuenza pandemic that erupted in 1918 was the ﬁrst great 
collision between nature and modern science. It was the ﬁrst great colli-
sion between a natural force and a society that included individuals who 
refused either to submit to that force or to simply call upon divine inter-
vention to save themselves from it, individuals who instead were deter-
mined to confront this force directly, with a developing technology and 
with their minds. 
In the United States, the story is particularly one of a handful of 
extraordinary people, of whom Paul Lewis is one. These were men and 
some very few women who, far from being backward, had already devel-
oped the fundamental science upon which much of today’s medicine is 
based. They had already developed vaccines and antitoxins and tech-
niques still in use. They had already pushed, in some cases, close to the 
edge of knowledge today. 
In a way, these researchers had spent much of their lives preparing for 
the confrontation that occurred in 1918 not only in general but, for a few 
"

The Great Influenza 
of them at least, quite speciﬁcally. In every war in American history so far, 
disease had killed more soldiers than combat. In many wars throughout 
history war had spread disease. The leaders of American research had 
anticipated that a major epidemic of some kind would erupt during the 
Great War. They had prepared for it as much as it was possible to prepare. 
Then they waited for it to strike. 
The story, however, begins earlier. Before medicine could confront this 
disease with any promise of effect, it had to become scientiﬁc. It had to be 
revolutionized. 
Medicine is not yet and may never be fully a science—the idiosyn-
crasies, physical and otherwise, of individual patients and doctors may 
prevent that—but, up to a few decades before World War I, the practice 
of medicine had remained quite literally almost unchanged from the 
time of Hippocrates more than two thousand years earlier. Then, in 
Europe ﬁrst, medical science changed and, ﬁnally, the practice of medi-
cine changed. 
But even after European medicine changed, medicine in the United 
States did not. In research and education especially, American medicine 
lagged far behind, and that made practice lag as well. 
While for decades European medical schools had, for example, re-
quired students to have a solid background in chemistry, biology, and 
other sciences, as late as 1900, it was more difﬁcult to get into a respect-
able American college than into an American medical school. At least one 
hundred U.S. medical schools would accept any man—but not woman— 
willing to pay tuition; at most 20 percent of the schools required even a 
high school diploma for admission—much less any academic training in 
science—and only a single medical school required its students to have a 
college degree. Nor, once students entered, did American schools necessar-
ily make up for any lack of scientiﬁc background. Many schools bestowed 
a medical degree upon students who simply attended lectures and passed 
examinations; in some, students could fail several courses, never touch a 
single patient, and still get a medical degree. 
Not until late—very late—in the nineteenth century, did a virtual 
handful of leaders of American medical science begin to plan a revolu-
tion that transformed American medicine from the most backward in 
the developed world into the best in the world.

Prologue 
William James, who was a friend of—and whose son would work 
for—several of these men, wrote that the collecting of a critical mass of 
men of genius could make a whole civilization “vibrate and shake.” These 
men intended to, and would, shake the world. 
To do so required not only intelligence and training but real courage, 
the courage to relinquish all support and all authority. Or perhaps it 
required only recklessness. 
In Faust, Goethe wrote, 
’Tis writ, “In the beginning was the Word.” 
I Pause, to wonder what is here inferred. 
The Word I cannot set supremely high: 
A new translation I will try. 
I read, if by the spirit, I am taught, 
This sense, “In the beginning was the Thought. . . .” 
Upon “the Word” rested authority, stability, and law; “the Thought” 
roiled and ripped apart and created—without knowledge or concern of 
what it would create. 
Shortly before the Great War began, the men who so wanted to trans-
form American medicine succeeded. They created a system that could 
produce people capable of thinking in a new way, capable of challenging 
the natural order. They, together with the ﬁrst generation of scientists 
they had trained—Paul Lewis and his few peers—formed a cadre who 
stood on alert, hoping against but expecting and preparing for the erup-
tion of an epidemic. 
When it came, they placed their lives in the path of the disease and 
applied all their knowledge and powers to defeat it. As it overwhelmed 
them, they concentrated on constructing the body of knowledge neces-
sary to eventually triumph. For the scientiﬁc knowledge that ultimately 
came out of the inﬂuenza pandemic pointed directly—and still points— 
to much that lies in medicine’s future.

n September 12, 1876, the crowd overﬂowing the auditorium of 
Baltimore’s Academy of Music was in a mood of hopeful excite-
ment, but excitement without frivolity. Indeed, despite an unusual num-
ber of women in attendance, many of them from the uppermost reaches 
of local society, a reporter noted, “There was no display of dress or fash-
ion.” For this occasion had serious purpose. It was to mark the launching 
of the Johns Hopkins University, an institution whose leaders intended 
not simply to found a new university but to change all of American edu-
cation; indeed, they sought considerably more than that. They planned to 
change the way in which Americans tried to understand and grapple with 
nature. The keynote speaker, the English scientist Thomas H. Huxley, 
personiﬁed their goals. 
The import was not lost on the nation. Many newspapers, including 
the New York Times, had reporters covering this event. After it, they 
would print Huxley’s address in full. 
For the nation was then, as it so often has been, at war with itself; in 
fact it was engaged in different wars simultaneously, each being waged on 
several fronts, wars that ran along the fault lines of modern America. 
One involved expansion and race. In the Dakotas, George Armstrong 
Custer had just led the Seventh Cavalry to its destruction at the hands of 
primitive savages resisting encroachment of the white man. The day 
Huxley spoke, the front page of the Washington Star reported that “the 
"
"12 
The Great Influenza 
hostile Sioux, well fed and well armed” had just carried out “a massacre 
of miners.” 
In the South a far more important but equally savage war was being 
waged as white Democrats sought “redemption” from Reconstruction in 
anticipation of the presidential election. Throughout the South “riﬂe 
clubs,” “saber clubs,” and “riﬂe teams” of former Confederates were being 
organized into infantry and cavalry units. Already accounts of intimida-
tion, beatings, whippings, and murder directed against Republicans and 
blacks had surfaced. After the murder of three hundred black men in a 
single Mississippi county, one man, convinced that words from the 
Democrats’ own mouths would convince the world of their design, 
pleaded with the New York Times, “For God’s sake publish the testimony 
of the Democrats before the Grand Jury.” 
Voting returns had already begun to come in—there was no single 
national election day—and two months later Democrat Samuel Tilden 
would win the popular vote by a comfortable margin. But he would never 
take ofﬁce as president. Instead the Republican secretary of war would 
threaten to “force a reversal” of the vote, federal troops with ﬁxed bayo-
nets would patrol Washington, and southerners would talk of reigniting 
the Civil War. That crisis would ultimately be resolved through an extra-
constitutional special committee and a political understanding: Republi-
cans would discard the voting returns of three states—Louisiana, Florida, 
South Carolina—and seize a single disputed electoral vote in Oregon to 
keep the presidency in the person of Rutherford B. Hayes. But they also 
would withdraw all federal troops from the South and cease intervening 
in southern affairs, leaving the Negroes there to fend for themselves. 
The war involving the Hopkins was more muted but no less pro-
found. The outcome would help deﬁne one element of the character of 
the nation: the extent to which the nation would accept or reject modern 
science and, to a lesser degree, how secular it would become, how godly it 
would remain. 
Precisely at 11:00 a.m., a procession of people advanced upon the 
stage. First came Daniel Coit Gilman, president of the Hopkins, and on 
his arm was Huxley. Following in single ﬁle came the governor, the 
mayor, and other notables. As they took their seats the conversations in 
the audience quickly died away, replaced by expectancy of a kind of dec-
laration of war. 
"
"13 
The Warriors 
Of medium height and middle age—though he already had iron-gray 
hair and nearly white whiskers—and possessed of what was described as 
“a pleasant face,” Huxley did not look the warrior. But he had a warrior’s 
ruthlessness. His dicta included the pronouncement: “The foundation of 
morality is to have done, once and for all, with lying.” A brilliant scientist, 
later president of the Royal Society, he advised investigators, “Sit down 
before a fact as a little child, be prepared to give up every preconceived 
notion. Follow humbly wherever and to whatever abysses nature leads, or 
you shall learn nothing.” He also believed that learning had purpose, stat-
ing, “The great end of life is not knowledge but action.” 
To act upon the world himself, he became a proselytizer for faith in 
human reason. By 1876 he had become the world’s foremost advocate of 
the theory of evolution and of science itself. Indeed, H. L. Mencken said 
that “it was he, more than any other man, who worked that great change 
in human thought which marked the Nineteenth Century.” Now Presi-
dent Gilman gave a brief and simple introduction. Then Professor Hux-
ley began to speak. 
Normally he lectured on evolution, but today he was speaking on a sub-
ject of even greater magnitude. He was speaking about the process of 
intellectual inquiry. The Hopkins was to be unlike any other university in 
America. Aiming almost exclusively at the education of graduate students 
and the furtherance of science, it was intended by its trustees to rival not 
Harvard or Yale—neither of them considered worthy of emulation—but 
the greatest institutions of Europe, and particularly Germany. Perhaps only 
in the United States, a nation ever in the act of creating itself, could such an 
institution come into existence both so fully formed in concept and already 
so renowned, even before the foundation of a single building had been laid. 
“His voice was low, clear and distinct,” reported one listener. “The 
audience paid the closest attention to every word which fell from the lec-
turer’s lips, occasionally manifesting their approval by applause.” Said 
another, “Professor Huxley’s method is slow, precise, and clear, and he 
guards the positions which he takes with astuteness and ability. He does 
not utter anything in the reckless fashion which conviction sometimes 
countenances and excuses, but rather with the deliberation that research 
and close inquiry foster.” 
Huxley commended the bold goals of the Hopkins, expounded upon 
his own theories of education—theories that soon informed those of 
"
"14 
The Great Influenza 
William James and John Dewey—and extolled the fact that the existence 
of the Hopkins meant “ﬁnally, that neither political nor ecclesiastical sec-
tarianism” would interfere with the pursuit of the truth. 
In truth, Huxley’s speech, read a century and a quarter later, seems 
remarkably tame. Yet Huxley and the entire ceremony left an impression 
in the country deep enough that Gilman would spend years trying to 
edge away from it, even while simultaneously trying to fulﬁll the goals 
Huxley applauded. 
For the ceremony’s most signiﬁcant word was one not spoken: not a 
single participant uttered the word “God” or made any reference to the 
Almighty. This spectacular omission scandalized those who worried 
about or rejected a mechanistic and necessarily godless view of the uni-
verse. And it came in an era in which American universities had nearly 
two hundred endowed chairs of theology and fewer than ﬁve in medi-
cine, an era in which the president of Drew University had said that, after 
much study and experience, he had concluded that only ministers of the 
Gospel should be college professors. 
The omission also served as a declaration: the Hopkins would pursue 
the truth, no matter to what abyss it led. 
In no area did the truth threaten so much as in the study of life. In no 
area did the United States lag behind the rest of the world so much as in 
its study of the life sciences and medicine. And in that area in particular 
the inﬂuence of the Hopkins would be immense. 
By 1918, as America marched into war, the nation had come not only 
to rely upon the changes wrought largely, though certainly not entirely, 
by men associated with the Hopkins; the United States Army had mobi-
lized these men into a special force, focused and disciplined, ready to hurl 
themselves at an enemy. 
The two most important questions in science are “What can I know?” 
and “How can I know it?” 
Science and religion in fact part ways over the ﬁrst question, what 
each can know. Religion, and to some extent philosophy, believes it can 
know, or at least address, the question, “Why?” 
For most religions the answer to this question ultimately comes down 
to the way God ordered it. Religion is inherently conservative; even one 
proposing a new God only creates a new order. 
"
"15 
The Warriors 
The question “why” is too deep for science. Science instead believes it 
can only learn “how” something occurs. 
The revolution of modern science and especially medical science 
began as science not only focused on this answer to “What can I know?” 
but more importantly, changed its method of inquiry, changed its answer 
to “How can I know it?” 
This answer involves not simply academic pursuits; it affects how a 
society governs itself, its structure, how its citizens live. If a society does 
set  Goethe’s  “Word . . . supremely high,”  if  it believes that it knows the 
truth and that it need not question its beliefs, then that society is more 
likely to enforce rigid decrees, and less likely to change. If it leaves room 
for doubt about the truth, it is more likely to be free and open. 
In the narrower context of science, the answer determines how indi-
viduals explore nature—how one does science. And the way one goes 
about answering a question, one’s methodology, matters as much as the 
question itself. For the method of inquiry underlies knowledge and often 
determines what one discovers: how one pursues a question often dic-
tates, or at least limits, the answer. 
Indeed, methodology matters more than anything else. Methodology 
subsumes, for example, Thomas Kuhn’s well-known theory of how sci-
ence advances. Kuhn gave the word “paradigm” wide usage by arguing 
that at any given point in time, a particular paradigm, a kind of perceived 
truth, dominates the thinking in any science. Others have applied his 
concept to nonscientiﬁc ﬁelds as well. 
According to Kuhn, the prevailing paradigm tends to freeze progress, 
indirectly by creating a mental obstacle to creative ideas and directly by, 
for example, blocking research funds from going to truly new ideas, espe-
cially if they conﬂict with the paradigm. He argues that nonetheless 
researchers eventually ﬁnd what he calls “anomalies” that do not ﬁt the 
paradigm. Each one erodes the foundation of the paradigm, and when 
enough accrue to undermine it, the paradigm collapses. Scientists then 
cast about for a new paradigm that explains both the old and new facts. 
But the process—and progress—of science is more ﬂuid than Kuhn’s 
concept suggests. It moves more like an amoeba, with soft and ill-deﬁned 
edges. More importantly, method matters. Kuhn’s own theory recognizes 
that the propelling force behind the movement from one explanation to 
another comes from the methodology, from what we call the scientiﬁc 
"
"16 
The Great Influenza 
method. But he takes as an axiom that those who ask questions constantly 
test existing hypotheses. In fact, with a methodology that probes and tests 
hypotheses—regardless of any paradigm—progress is inevitable. With-
out such a methodology, progress becomes merely coincendental. 
Yet the scientiﬁc method has not always been used by those who 
inquire into nature. Through most of known history, investigators trying 
to penetrate the natural world, penetrate what we call science, relied 
upon the mind alone, reason alone. These investigators believed that they 
could know a thing if their knowledge followed logically from what they 
considered a sound premise. In turn they based their premises chieﬂy on 
observation. 
This commitment to logic coupled with man’s ambition to see the 
entire world in a comprehensive and cohesive way actually imposed 
blinders on science in general and on medicine in particular. The chief 
enemy of progress, ironically, became pure reason. And for the bulk of 
two and a half millennia—twenty-ﬁve hundred years—the actual treat-
ment of patients by physicians made almost no progress at all. 
One cannot blame religion or superstition for this lack of progress. In 
the West, beginning at least ﬁve hundred years before the birth of Christ, 
medicine was largely secular. While Hippocratic healers—the various 
Hippocratic texts were written by different people—did run temples and 
accept pluralistic explanations for disease, they pushed for material 
explanations. 
Hippocrates himself was born in approximately 460 b.c. On the Sa-
cred Disease, one of the more famous Hippocratic texts and one often at-
tributed to him directly, even mocked theories that attributed epilepsy to 
the intervention of gods. He and his followers advocated precise observa-
tion, then theorizing. As the texts stated, “For a theory is a composite 
memory of things apprehended with sense perception.” “But conclusions 
which are merely verbal cannot bear fruit.” “I approve of theorizing also 
if it lays its foundation in incident, and deduces its conclusion in accor-
dance with phenomena.” 
But if such an approach sounds like that of a modern investigator, a 
modern scientist, it lacked two singularly important elements. 
First, Hippocrates and his associates merely observed nature. They did 
not probe it. 
"
"17 
The Warriors 
This failure to probe nature was to some extent understandable. To 
dissect a human body then was inconceivable. But the authors of the 
Hippocratic texts did not test their conclusions and theories. A theory 
must make a prediction to be useful or scientiﬁc—ultimately it must say, 
If this, then that—and testing that prediction is the single most important 
element of modern methodology. Once that prediction is tested, it must 
advance another one for testing. It can never stand still. 
Those who wrote the Hippocratic texts, however, observed passively 
and reasoned actively. Their careful observations noted mucus dis-
charges, menstrual bleeding, watery evacuations in dysentery, and they 
very likely observed blood left to stand, which over time separates into 
several layers, one nearly clear, one of somewhat yellowy serum, one of 
darker blood. Based on these observations, they hypothesized that there 
were four kinds of bodily ﬂuids, or “humours”: blood, phlegm, bile, and 
black bile. (This terminology survives today in the phrase “humoral 
immunity,” which refers to elements of the immune system, such as anti-
bodies, that circulate in the blood.) 
This hypothesis made sense, comported with observations, and could 
explain many symptoms. It explained, for example, that coughs were 
caused by the ﬂow of phlegm to the chest. Observations of people cough-
ing up phlegm certainly supported this conclusion. 
In a far broader sense, the hypothesis also conformed to the ways in 
which the Greeks saw nature: they observed four seasons, four aspects of 
the environment—cold, hot, wet, and dry—and four elements—earth, 
air, ﬁre, and water. 
Medicine waited six hundred years for the next major advance, for 
Galen, but Galen did not break from these teachings; he systematized 
them, perfected them. Galen claimed, “I have done as much for medicine 
as Trajan did for the Roman Empire when he built the bridges and roads 
through Italy. It is I, and I alone, who have revealed the true path of med-
icine. It must be admitted that Hippocrates already staked out this 
path. . . . He prepared the way, but I have made it possible.” 
Galen did not simply observe passively. He dissected animals and, 
although he did not perform autopsies on humans, served as a physician 
to gladiators whose wounds allowed him to see deep beneath the skin. 
Thus his anatomic knowledge went far beyond that of any known pre-
decessor. But he remained chieﬂy a theoretician, a logician; he imposed 
"
"18 
The Great Influenza 
order on the Hippocratic body of work, reconciling conﬂicts, reason-
ing so clearly that, if one accepted his premises, his conclusions seemed 
inevitable. He made the humoral theory perfectly logical, and even ele-
gant. As historian Vivian Nutton notes, he raised the theory to a truly 
conceptual level, separating the humours from direct correlation with 
bodily ﬂuids and making them invisible entities “recognizable only 
by logic.” 
Galen’s works were translated into Arabic and underlay both Western 
and Islamic medicine for nearly ﬁfteen hundred years before facing any 
signiﬁcant challenge. Like the Hippocratic writers, Galen believed that 
illness was essentially the result of an imbalance in the body. He also 
thought that balance could be restored by intervention; a physician thus 
could treat a disease successfully. If there was a poison in the body, then 
the poison could be removed by evacuation. Sweating, urinating, defe-
cating, and vomiting were all ways that could restore balance. Such beliefs 
led physicians to recommend violent laxatives and other purgatives, as 
well as mustard plasters and other prescriptions that punished the body, 
that blistered it and theoretically restored balance. And of all the prac-
tices of medicine over the centuries, one of the the most enduring—yet 
least understandable to us today—was a perfectly logical extension of 
Hippocratic and Galenic thought, and recommended by both. 
This practice was bleeding patients. Bleeding was among the most 
common therapies employed to treat all manner of disorders. 
Deep into the nineteenth century, Hippocrates and most of those 
who followed him also believed that natural processes must not be inter-
fered with. The various kinds of purging were meant to augment and 
accelerate natural processes, not resist them. Since pus, for example, was 
routinely seen in all kinds of wounds, pus was seen as a necessary part of 
healing. Until the late 1800s, physicians routinely would do nothing to 
avoid the generation of pus, and were reluctant even to drain it. Instead 
they referred to “laudable pus.” 
Similarly, Hippocrates scorned surgery as intrusive, as interfering 
with nature’s course; further, he saw it as a purely mechanical skill, 
beneath the calling of physicians who dealt in a far more intellectual 
realm. This intellectual arrogance would subsume the attitude of Western 
physicians for more than two thousand years. 
This is not to say that for two thousand years the Hippocratic texts 
"

and Galen offered the only theoretical constructs to explain health and 
disease. Many ideas and theories were advanced about how the body 
worked, how illness developed. And a rival school of thought gradually 
developed within the Hippocratic-Galenic tradition that valued experi-
ence and empiricism and challenged the purely theoretical. 
It is impossible to summarize all these theories in a few sentences, yet 
nearly all of them did share certain concepts: that health was a state of 
equilibrium and balance, and that illness resulted either from an internal 
imbalance within the body, or from external environmental inﬂuences 
such as an atmospheric miasma, or some combination of both. 
But in the early 1500s three men began to challenge at least the meth-
ods of medicine. Paracelsus declared he would investigate nature “not by 
following that which those of old taught, but by our own observation of 
nature,  conﬁrmed  by  . . . experiment  and by reasoning thereon.” 
Vesalius dissected human corpses and concluded that Galen’s ﬁndings 
had come from animals and were deeply ﬂawed. For his acts Vesalius was 
sentenced to death, although the sentence was commuted. 
Fracastorius, an astronomer, mathematician, botanist, and poet, mean-
while hypothesized that diseases had speciﬁc causes and that contagion 
“passes from one thing to another and is originally caused by infection 
of the imperceptible particle.” One medical historian called his body of 
work “a peak maybe unequalled by anyone between Hippocrates and 
Pasteur.” 
The contemporaries of these three men included Martin Luther and 
Copernicus, men who changed the world. In medicine the new ideas of 
Paracelsus, Vesalius, and Fracastorius did not change the world. In the 
actual practice of medicine they changed nothing at all. 
But the approach they called for did create ripples while the scholas-
ticism of the Middle Ages that stultiﬁed nearly all ﬁelds of inquiry was 
beginning to decay. In 1605 Francis Bacon in Rerum Novarum attacked 
the purely deductive reasoning of logic, calling “Aristotle . . . a mere  
bond-servant to his logic, thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh 
useless.” He also complained, “The logic now in use serves rather to ﬁx 
and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly 
received notions than to help the search after truth. So it does more harm 
than good.” 
In 1628 Harvey traced the circulation of the blood, arguably perhaps 
"
"20 
The Great Influenza 
the single greatest achievement of medicine—and certainly the greatest 
achievement until the late 1800s. And Europe was in intellectual ferment. 
Half a century later Newton revolutionized physics and mathematics. 
Newton’s contemporary John Locke, trained as a physician, emphasized 
the pursuit of knowledge through experience. In 1753 James Lind con-
ducted a pioneering controlled experiment among British sailors and 
demonstrated that scurvy could be prevented by eating limes—ever 
since, the British have been called “limeys.” David Hume, after this 
demonstration and following Locke, led a movement of “empiricism.” 
His contemporary John Hunter made a brilliant scientiﬁc study of sur-
gery, elevating it from a barber’s craft. Hunter also performed model sci-
entiﬁc experiments, including some on himself—as when he infected 
himself with pus from a gonorrheal case to prove a hypothesis. 
Then in 1798 Edward Jenner, a student of Hunter’s—Hunter had told 
him “Don’t think. Try.”—published his work. As a young medical student 
Jenner had heard a milkmaid say, “I cannot take the smallpox because I 
have had cowpox.” The cowpox virus resembles smallpox so closely that 
exposure to cowpox gives immunity to smallpox. But cowpox itself only 
rarely develops into a serious disease. (The virus that causes cowpox is 
called “vaccinia,” taking its name from vaccination.) 
Jenner’s work with cowpox was a landmark, but not because he was 
the ﬁrst to immunize people against smallpox. In China, India, and Per-
sia, different techniques had long since been developed to expose chil-
dren to smallpox and make them immune, and in Europe at least as early 
as the 1500s laypeople—not physicians—took material from a pustule of 
those with a mild case of smallpox and scratched it into the skin of those 
who had not yet caught the disease. Most people infected this way devel-
oped mild cases and became immune. In 1721 in Massachusetts, Cotton 
Mather took the advice of an African slave, tried this technique, and 
staved off a lethal epidemic. But “variolation” could kill. Vaccinating with 
cowpox was far safer than variolation. 
From a scientiﬁc standpoint, however, Jenner’s most important con-
tribution was his rigorous methodology. Of his ﬁnding he said, “I placed 
it upon a rock where I knew it would be immoveable before I invited the 
public to take a look at it.” 
But ideas die hard. Even as Jenner was conducting his experiments, 
despite the vast increase in knowledge of the body derived from Harvey 
"
"21 
The Warriors 
and Hunter, medical practice had barely changed. And many, if not most, 
physicians who thought deeply about medicine still saw it in terms of 
logic and observation alone. 
In Philadelphia, twenty-two hundred years after Hippocrates and six-
teen hundred years after Galen, Benjamin Rush, a pioneer in his views on 
mental illness, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and Amer-
ica’s most prominent physician, still applied logic and observation alone 
to build “a more simple and consistent system of medicine than the 
world had yet seen.” 
In 1796 he advanced a hypothesis as logical and elegant, he believed, 
as Newtonian physics. Observing that all fevers were associated with 
ﬂushed skin, he concluded that this was caused by distended capillaries 
and reasoned that the proximate cause of fever must be abnormal “con-
vulsive action” in these vessels. He took this a step further and concluded 
that all fevers resulted from disturbance of capillaries, and, since the cap-
illaries were part of the circulatory system, he concluded that a hyperten-
sion of the entire circulatory system was involved. Rush proposed to 
reduce this convulsive action by “depletion,” i.e., venesection—bleeding. 
It made perfect sense. 
He was one of the most aggressive of the advocates of “heroic medi-
cine.” The heroism, of course, was found in the patient. In the early 1800s 
praise for his theories was heard throughout Europe, and one London 
physician said Rush united “in an almost unprecedented degree, sagacity 
and judgment.” 
A reminder of the medical establishment’s acceptance of bleeding 
exists today in the name of the British journal The Lancet, one of the 
leading medical journals in the world. A lancet was the instrument physi-
cians used to cut into a patient’s vein. 
But if the ﬁrst failing of medicine, a failing that endured virtually 
unchallenged for two millennia and then only gradually eroded over the 
next three centuries, was that it did not probe nature through experi-
ments, that it simply observed and reasoned from observation to a con-
clusion, that failing was—ﬁnally—about to be corrected. 
What can I know? How can I know it? 
If reason alone could solve mathematical problems, if Newton could 
think his way through physics, then why could not man reason out the 
"
"22 
The Great Influenza 
ways in which the body worked? Why did reason alone fail so utterly in 
medicine? 
One explanation is that Hippocratic and Galenic theory did offer a 
system of therapeutics that seemed to produce the desired effect. They 
seemed to work. So the Hippocratic-Galenic model lasted so long not 
only because of its logical consistency, but because its therapies seemed to 
have effect. 
Indeed, bleeding—today called “phlebotomy”—can actually help in 
some rare diseases, such as polycythemia, a rare genetic disorder that 
causes people to make too much blood, or hemachromatosis, when the 
blood carries too much iron. And in far more common cases of acute 
pulmonary edema, when the lungs ﬁll with ﬂuid, it could relieve imme-
diate symptoms and is still sometimes tried. For example, in congestive 
heart failure excess ﬂuid in the lungs can make victims extremely uncom-
fortable and, ultimately, kill them if the heart cannot pump the ﬂuid out. 
When people suffering from these conditions were bled, they may well 
have been helped. This reinforced theory. 
Even when physicians observed that bleeding weakened the patient, 
that weakening could still seem positive. If a patient was ﬂushed with a 
fever, it followed logically that if bleeding alleviated those symptoms— 
making the patient pale—it was a good thing. If it made the patient pale 
it worked. 
Finally, a euphoric feeling sometimes accompanies blood loss. This 
too reinforced theory. So bleeding both made logical sense in the Hippo-
cratic and Galenic systems and sometimes gave physicians and patients 
positive reinforcement. 
Other therapies also did what they were designed to do—in a sense. 
As late as the nineteenth century—until well after the Civil War in the 
United States—most physicians and patients still saw the body only as an 
interdependent whole, still saw a speciﬁc symptom as a result of an imbal-
ance or disequilibrium in the entire body, still saw illness chieﬂy as some-
thing within and generated by the body itself. As the historian Charles 
Rosenberg has pointed out, even smallpox, despite its known clinical course 
and the fact that vaccination prevented it, was still seen as a manifestation 
of a systemic ill. And medical traditions outside the Hippocratic-Galenic 
model—from the “subluxations” of chiropractic to the “yin and yang” of 
"
"23 
The Warriors 
Chinese medicine—have also tended to see disease as a result of imbal-
ance within the body. 
Physicians and patients wanted therapies to augment and accelerate, 
not block, the natural course of disease, the natural healing process. The 
state of the body could be altered by prescribing such toxic substances as 
mercury, arsenic, antimony, and iodine. Therapies designed to blister the 
body did so. Therapies designed to produce sweating or vomiting did so. 
One doctor, for example, when confronted with a case of pleurisy, gave 
camphor and recorded that the case was “suddenly relieved by profuse 
perspiration.” His intervention, he believed, had cured. 
Yet a patient’s improvement, of course, does not prove that a therapy 
works. For example, the 1889 edition of the Merck Manual of Medical Infor-
mation recommended one hundred treatments for bronchitis, each one 
with its fervent believers, yet the current editor of the manual recognizes 
that “none of them worked.” The manual also recommended, among 
other things, champagne, strychnine, and nitrogylcerin for seasickness. 
And when a therapy clearly did not work, the intricacies—and in-
timacies—of the doctor-patient relationship also came into play, injecting 
emotion into the equation. One truth has not changed from the time of 
Hippocrates until today: when faced with desperate patients, doctors 
often do not have the heart—or, more accurately, they have too much 
heart—to do nothing. And so a doctor, as desperate as the patient, may 
try anything, including things he or she knows will not work as long as 
they will not harm. At the least, the patient will get some solace. 
One cancer specialist concedes, “I do virtually the same thing myself. 
If I’m treating a teary, desperate patient, I will try low-dose alpha inter-
feron, even though I do not believe it has ever cured a single person. It 
doesn’t have side effects, and it gives the patient hope.” 
Cancer provides other examples as well. No truly scientiﬁc evidence 
shows that echinacea has any effect on cancer, yet it is widely prescribed 
in Germany today for terminal cancer patients. Japanese physicians rou-
tinely prescribe placebos in treatment. Steven Rosenberg, a National Can-
cer Institute scientist who was the ﬁrst person to stimulate the immune 
system to cure cancer and who led the team that performed the ﬁrst human 
gene therapy experiments, points out that for years chemotherapy was 
recommended to virtually all victims of pancreatic cancer even though 
"
"24 
The Great Influenza 
not a single chemotherapy regimen had ever been shown to prolong their 
lives for one day. (At this writing, investigators have just demonstrated 
that gemcitabine can extend median life expectancy by one to two months, 
but it is highly toxic.) 
Another explanation for the failure of logic and observation alone to 
advance medicine is that unlike, say, physics, which uses a form of logic— 
mathematics—as its natural language, biology does not lend itself to 
logic. Leo Szilard, a prominent physicist, made this point when he com-
plained that after switching from physics to biology he never had a peace-
ful bath again. As a physicist he would soak in the warmth of a bathtub 
and contemplate a problem, turn it in his mind, reason his way through 
it. But once he became a biologist, he constantly had to climb out of the 
bathtub to look up a fact. 
In fact, biology is chaos. Biological systems are the product not of 
logic but of evolution, an inelegant process. Life does not choose the log-
ically best design to meet a new situation. It adapts what already exists. 
Much of the human genome includes genes which are “conserved”; i.e., 
which are essentially the same as those in much simpler species. Evolu-
tion has built upon what already exists. 
The result, unlike the clean straight lines of logic, is often irregular, 
messy. An analogy might be building an energy efﬁcient farmhouse. If 
one starts from scratch, logic would impel the use of certain building 
materials, the design of windows and doors with kilowatt hours in mind, 
perhaps the inclusion of solar panels on the roof, and so on. But if one 
wants to make an eighteenth-century farmhouse energy efﬁcient, one 
adapts it as well as possible. One proceeds logically, doing things that 
make good sense given what one starts with, given the existing farm-
house. One seals and caulks and insulates and puts in a new furnace or 
heat pump. The old farmhouse will be—maybe—the best one could do 
given where one started, but it will be irregular; in window size, in ceiling 
height, in building materials, it will bear little resemblance to a new farm-
house designed from scratch for maximum energy efﬁciency. 
For logic to be of use in biology, one has to apply it from a given start-
ing point, using the then-extant rules of the game. Hence Szilard had to 
climb out of the bathtub to look up a fact. 
Ultimately, then, logic and observation failed to penetrate the work-
"
"25 
The Warriors 
ings of the body not because of the power of the Hippocratic hypothesis, 
the Hippocratic paradigm. Logic and observation failed because neither 
one tested the hypothesis rigorously. 
Once investigators began to apply something akin to the modern sci-
entiﬁc method, the old hypothesis collapsed. 
By 1800 enormous advances had been made in other sciences, beginning 
centuries earlier with a revolution in the use of quantitative measurement. 
Bacon and Descartes, although opposites in their views of the usefulness 
of pure logic, had both provided a philosophical framework for new ways 
of seeing the natural world. Newton had in a way bridged their differences, 
advancing mathematics through logic while relying upon experiment 
and observation for conﬁrmation. Joseph Priestley, Henry Cavendish, 
and Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier created modern chemistry and penetrated 
the natural world. Particularly important for biology was Lavoisier’s 
decoding of the chemistry of combustion and use of those insights to un-
cover the chemical processes of respiration, of breathing. 
Still, all these advances notwithstanding, in 1800 Hippocrates and 
Galen would have recognized and largely agreed with most medical prac-
tice. In 1800 medicine remained what one historian called “the withered 
arm of science.” 
In the nineteenth century that ﬁnally began to change—and with 
extraordinary rapidity. Perhaps the greatest break came with the French 
Revolution, when the new French government established what came to 
be called “the Paris clinical school.” One leader of the movement was 
Xavier Bichat, who dissected organs, found them composed of discrete 
types of material often found in layers, and called them “tissues”; another 
was René Laennec, inventor of the stethoscope. 
Meanwhile, medicine began to make use of other objective measure-
ments and mathematics. This too was new. Hippocratic writings had stated 
that the physician’s senses mattered far more than any objective measure-
ment, so despite medicine’s use of logic, physicians had always avoided 
applying mathematics to the study of the body or disease. In the 1820s, two 
hundred years after the discovery of thermometers, French clinicians began 
using them. Clinicians also began taking advantage of methods discov-
ered in the 1700s to measure the pulse and blood pressure precisely. 
By then in Paris Pierre Louis had taken an even more signiﬁcant step. 
"
"26 
The Great Influenza 
In the hospitals, where hundreds of charity cases awaited help, using the 
most basic mathematical analysis—nothing more than arithmetic—he 
correlated the different treatments patients received for the same disease 
with the results. For the ﬁrst time in history, a physician was creating a 
reliable and systematic database. Physicians could have done this earlier. 
To do so required neither microscopes nor technological prowess; it 
required only taking careful notes. 
Yet the real point at which modern medicine diverged from the clas-
sic was in the studies of pathological anatomy by Louis and others. Louis 
not only correlated treatments with results to reach a conclusion about a 
treatment’s efﬁcacy (he rejected bleeding patients as a useless therapy), 
he and others also used autopsies to correlate the condition of organs 
with symptoms. He and others dissected organs, compared diseased 
organs to healthy ones, learned their functions in intimate detail. 
What he found was astounding, and compelling, and helped lead to 
a new conception of disease as something with an identity of its own, an 
objective existence. In the 1600s Thomas Sydenham had begun classify-
ing diseases, but Sydenham and most of his followers continued to see dis-
ease as a result of imbalances, consistent with Hippocrates and Galen. 
Now a new “nosology,” a new classiﬁcation and listing of disease, began to 
evolve. 
Disease began to be seen as something that invaded solid parts of the 
body, as an independent entity, instead of being a derangement of the blood. 
This was a fundamental ﬁrst step in what would become a revolution. 
Louis’s inﬂuence and that of what became known as “the numerical 
system” could not be overstated. These advances—the stethoscope, laryn-
goscope, opthalmoscope, the measurements of temperature and blood 
pressure, the study of parts of the body—all created distance between the 
doctor and the patient, as well as between patient and disease; they objec-
tiﬁed humanity. Even though no less a personage than Michel Foucault 
condemned this Parisian movement as the ﬁrst to turn the human body 
into an object, these steps had to come to make progress in medicine. 
But the movement was condemned by contemporaries also. Com-
plained one typical critic, “The practice of medicine according to this 
view is entirely empirical, is shorn of all rational induction, and takes a 
position among the lower grades of experimental observations and frag-
mentary facts.” 
"
"27 
The Warriors 
Criticism notwithstanding, the numerical system began winning con-
vert after convert. In England in the 1840s and 1850s, John Snow began 
applying mathematics in a new way: as an epidemiologist. He had made 
meticulous observations of the patterns of a cholera outbreak, noting 
who got sick and who did not, where the sick lived and how they lived, 
where the healthy lived and how they lived. He tracked the disease down 
to a contaminated well in London. He concluded that contaminated 
water caused the disease. It was brilliant detective work, brilliant epi-
demiology. William Budd borrowed Snow’s methodology and promptly 
applied it to the study of typhoid. 
Snow and Budd needed no scientiﬁc knowledge, no laboratory ﬁnd-
ings, to reach their conclusions. And they did so in the 1850s, before the 
development of the germ theory of disease. Like Louis’s study that proved 
that bleeding was worse than useless in nearly all circumstances, their 
work could have been conducted a century earlier or ten centuries earlier. 
But their work reﬂected a new way of looking at the world, a new way of 
seeking explanations, a new methodology, a new use of mathematics as 
an analytical tool.* 
*The effort to correlate treatments and results has not yet triumphed. A “new” 
movement called “evidence-based medicine” has emerged recently, which continues 
to try to determine the best treatments and communicate them to physicians. No 
good physician today would discard the value of statistics, of evidence accumulated 
systematically in careful studies. But individual doctors, convinced either by anec-
dotal evidence from their own personal experience or by tradition, still criticize the 
use of statistics and probabilities to determine treatments and accept conclusions 
only reluctantly. Despite convincing studies, for example, it took years before cancer 
surgeons stopped doing radical mastectomies for all breast cancers. 
A related issue involves the methodology in “clinical studies”—i.e., studies using 
people. To stay with cancer as an example, Vince DeVita, former director of the 
National Cancer Institute; Samuel Hellman, a leading oncologist; and Steven Rosen-
berg, chief of the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute coauthor a stan-
dard reference for physicians on cancer treatments. DeVita and Rosenberg believe 
that carefully controlled randomized studies—experiments in which random chance 
determines the treatment given a patient—are necessary to ﬁnd out what treatment 
works best. Yet Hellman has argued in the New England Journal of Medicine that ran-
domized trials are unethical. He believes that physicians must always use their best 
judgment to determine treatment and cannot rely on chance, even when the effec-
tiveness of a treatment is unknown, even to answer a question about what treatment 
works best, even when the patient has given fully informed consent.

At the same time, medicine was advancing by borrowing from other sci-
ences. Insights from physics allowed investigators to trace electrical 
impulses through nerve ﬁbers. Chemists were breaking down the cell 
into its components. And when investigators began using a magniﬁcent 
new tool—the microscope equipped with new achromatic lenses, which 
came into use in the 1830s—an even wider universe began to open. 
In this universe Germans took the lead, partly because fewer French 
than Germans chose to use microscopes and partly because French 
physicians in the middle of the nineteenth century were generally less 
aggressive in experimenting, in creating controlled conditions to probe 
and even manipulate nature. (It was no coincidence that the French 
giants Pasteur and Claude Bernard, who did conduct experiments, were 
not on the faculty of any medical school. Echoing Hunter’s advice to Jen-
ner, Bernard, a physiologist, told one American student, “Why think? 
Exhaustively experiment, then think.”) 
In Germany, meanwhile, Rudolf Virchow—both he and Bernard re-
ceived their medical degrees in 1843—was creating the ﬁeld of cellular 
pathology, the idea that disease began at the cellular level. And in Ger-
many great laboratories were being established around brilliant scientists 
who, more than elsewhere, did actively probe nature with experiments. 
Jacob Henle, the ﬁrst scientist to formulate the modern germ theory, 
echoed Francis Bacon when he said, “Nature answers only when she is 
questioned.” 
And in France, Pasteur was writing, “I am on the edge of mysteries 
and the veil is getting thinner and thinner.” 
Never had there been a time so exciting in medicine. A universe was 
opening. 
Still, with the exception of the ﬁndings on cholera and typhoid—and 
even these won only slow acceptance—little of this new scientiﬁc knowl-
edge could be translated into curing or preventing disease. And much 
that was being discovered was not understood. In 1868, for example, a 
Swiss investigator isolated deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, from a cell’s 
nucleus, but he had no idea of its function. Not until three-quarters of a 
century later, at the conclusion of some research directly related to the 
1918 inﬂuenza pandemic, did anyone even speculate, much less demon-
strate, that DNA carried genetic information. 
"

So the advances of science actually, and ironically, led to “therapeutic 
nihilism.” Physicians became disenchanted with traditional treatments, 
but they had nothing with which to replace them. In response to the ﬁnd-
ings of Louis and others, in 1835 Harvard’s Jacob Bigelow had argued in 
a major address that in “the unbiased opinion of most medical men of 
sound judgment and long experience . . . the amount of death and disas-
ter in the world would be less, if all disease were left to itself.” 
His address had impact. It also expressed the chaos into which medi-
cine was being thrown and the frustration of its practitioners. Physicians 
were abandoning the approaches of just a few years earlier and, less cer-
tain of the usefulness of a therapy, were becoming far less interventionist. 
In Philadelphia in the early 1800s Rush had called for wholesale blood-
letting and was widely applauded. In 1862 in Philadelphia a study found 
that, out of 9,502 cases, physicians had cut a vein “in one instance only.” 
Laymen as well were losing faith in and becoming reluctant to submit 
to the tortures of heroic medicine. And since the new knowledge develop-
ing in traditional medicine had not yet developed new therapies, rival ideas 
of disease and treatment began to emerge. Some of these theories were 
pseudoscience, and some owed as little to science as did a religious sect. 
This chaos was by no means limited to America. Typical was Samuel 
Hahnemann, who developed homeopathy in Germany, publishing his 
ideas in 1810, just before German science began to emerge as the domi-
nant force on the Continent. But nowhere did individuals feel freer to 
question authority than in America. And nowhere was the chaos greater. 
Samuel Thomson, founder of a movement bearing his name that 
spread widely before the Civil War, argued that medicine was simple 
enough to be comprehended by everyone, so anyone could act as a physi-
cian. “May the time soon come when men and women will become their 
own priests, physicians, and lawyers—when self-government, equal rights 
and moral philosophy will take the place of all popular crafts of every de-
scription,” argued his movement’s publication. His system used “botanic” 
therapeutics, and he charged, “False theory and hypothesis constitute 
nearly the whole art of physic.” 
Thomsonism was the most popular layman’s medical movement but 
hardly the only one. Dozens of what can only be called sects arose across 
the countryside. A Thomsonian rhyme summed up the attitude: “The 
nest of college-birs are three, / Law, Physic and Divinity; / And while these 
"
"30 
The Great Influenza 
three remain combined, / They keep the world oppressed and blind / . . .  
Now is the time to be set free, / From priests’ and Doctors’ slavery.” 
As these ideas spread, as traditional physicians failed to demonstrate 
the ability to cure anyone, as democratic emotions and anti-elitism swept the 
nation with Andrew Jackson, American medicine became as wild and dem-
ocratic as the frontier. In the 1700s Britain had relaxed licensing standards 
for physicians. Now several state legislatures did away with the licensing 
of physicians entirely. Why should there be any licensing requirements? 
Did physicians know anything? Could they heal anyone? Wrote one com-
mentator in 1846, “There is not a greater aristocratic monopoly in exis-
tence, than this of regular medicine—neither is there a greater humbug.” 
In England the title “Professor” was reserved for those who held uni-
versity chairs, and, even after John Hunter brought science to surgery, 
surgeons often went by “Mister.” In America the titles “Professor” and 
“Doctor” went to anyone who claimed them. As late as 1900, forty-one 
states licensed pharmacists, thirty-ﬁve licensed dentists, and only thirty-
four licensed physicians. A typical medical journal article in 1858 asked, 
“To What Cause Are We to Attribute the Diminished Respectability of 
the Medical Profession in the Esteem of the American Public?” 
By the Civil War, American medicine had begun to inch forward, but 
only inch. The brightest lights involved surgery. The development of 
anesthesia, ﬁrst demonstrated in 1846 at Massachusetts General Hospi-
tal, helped dramatically, and, just as Galen’s experience with gladiators 
taught him much anatomy, American surgeons learned enough from the 
war to put them a step ahead of Europeans. 
In the case of infectious and other disease, however, physicians con-
tinued to attack the body with mustard plasters that blistered the body, 
along with arsenic, mercury, and other poisons. Too many physicians 
continued their adherence to grand philosophical systems, and the Civil 
War showed how little the French inﬂuence had yet penetrated American 
medicine. European medical schools taught the use of thermometers, 
stethoscopes, and ophthalmoscopes, but Americans rarely used them and 
the largest Union army had only half a dozen thermometers. Americans 
still relieved pain by applying opiate powders on a wound, instead of in-
jecting opium with syringes. And when Union Surgeon General William 
Hammond banned some of the violent purgatives, he was both court-
martialed and condemned by the American Medical Association.

After the Civil War, America continued to churn out prophets of new, 
simple, complete, and self-contained systems of healing, two of which, 
chiropractic and Christian Science, survive today. (Evidence does suggest 
that spinal manipulation can relieve musculoskeletal conditions, but no 
evidence supports chiropractic claims that disease is caused by misalign-
ment of vertebrae.) 
Medicine had discovered drugs—such as quinine, digitalis, and 
opium—that provided beneﬁts, but, as one historian has shown, they 
were routinely prescribed indiscriminately, for their overall effect on the 
body, not for a speciﬁc purpose; even quinine was prescribed generally, 
not to treat malaria. Hence Oliver Wendell Holmes, the physician father 
of the Supreme Court justice, was not much overstating when he 
declared, “I ﬁrmly believe that if the whole materia medica, as now used, 
could be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for 
mankind—and all the worse for the ﬁshes.” 
There was something else about America. It was such a practical 
place. If it was a nation bursting with energy, it had no patience for dal-
liance or daydreaming or the waste of time. In 1832, Louis had told one 
of his most promising protégés—an American—to spend several years in 
research before beginning a medical practice. The student’s father was 
also a physician, James Jackson, a founder of Massachusetts General Hos-
pital, who scornfully rejected Louis’s suggestion and protested to Louis 
that “in this country his course would have been so singular, as in a mea-
sure to separate him from other men. We are a business doing people. . . .  
There is a vast deal to be done and he who will not be doing must be set 
down as a drone.” 
In America the very fact that science was undermining therapeutics 
made institutions uninterested in supporting it. Physics, chemistry, and 
the practical arts of engineering thrived. The number of engineers par-
ticularly was exploding—from 7,000 to 226,000 from the late nineteenth 
century to just after World War I—and they were accomplishing extraor-
dinary things. Engineers transformed steel production from an art into a 
science, developed the telegraph, laid a cable connecting America to Europe, 
built railroads crossing the continent and skyscrapers that climbed up-
ward, developed the telephone—with automobiles and airplanes not far 
behind. The world was being transformed. Whatever was being learned 
in the laboratory about biology was building basic knowledge, but with 
"

the exception of anesthesia, laboratory research had only proven actual 
medical practice all but useless while providing nothing with which to 
replace it. 
Still, by the 1870s, European medical schools required and gave rigor-
ous scientiﬁc training and were generally subsidized by the state. In con-
trast, most American medical schools were owned by a faculty whose 
proﬁts and salaries—even when they did not own the school—were paid 
by student fees, so the schools often had no admission standards other 
than the ability to pay tuition. No medical school in America allowed 
medical students to routinely either perform autopsies or see patients, 
and medical education often consisted of nothing more than two four-
month terms of lectures. Few medical schools had any association with a 
university, and fewer still had ties to a hospital. In 1870 even at Harvard a 
medical student could fail four of nine courses and still get an M.D. 
In the United States, a few isolated individuals did research— 
outstanding research—but it was unsupported by any institution. S. Weir 
Mitchell, America’s leading experimental physiologist, once wrote that he 
dreaded anything “removing from me the time or power to search for 
new truths that lie about me so thick.” Yet in the 1870s, after he had 
already developed an international reputation, after he had begun exper-
iments with snake venom that would lead directly to a basic understand-
ing of the immune system and the development of antitoxins, he was 
denied positions teaching physiology at both the University of Pennsyl-
vania and Jefferson Medical College; neither had any interest in research, 
nor a laboratory for either teaching or research purposes. In 1871 Har-
vard did create the ﬁrst laboratory of experimental medicine at any 
American university, but that laboratory was relegated to an attic and 
paid for by the professor’s father. Also in 1871 Harvard’s professor of 
pathologic anatomy confessed he did not know how to use a microscope. 
But Charles Eliot, a Brahmin with a birth defect that deformed one 
side of his face—he never allowed a photograph to show that side—had 
become Harvard president in 1869. In his ﬁrst report as president, he 
declared, “The whole system of medical education in this country needs 
thorough reformation. The ignorance and general incompetency of the 
average graduate of the American medical Schools, at the time when he 
receives the degree which turns him loose upon the community, is some-
thing horrible to contemplate.” 
"
"33 
The Warriors 
Soon after this declaration, a newly minted Harvard physician killed 
three successive patients because he did not know the lethal dose of mor-
phine. Even with the leverage of this scandal, Eliot could push through only 
modest reforms over a resistant faculty. Professor of Surgery Henry Bigelow, 
the most powerful faculty member, protested to the Harvard Board of 
Overseers, “[Eliot] actually proposes to have written examinations for the 
degree of doctor of medicine. I had to tell him that he knew nothing 
about the quality of the Harvard medical students. More than half of 
them can barely write. Of course they can’t pass written examinations. . . .  
No medical school has thought it proper to risk large existing classes and 
large receipts by introducing more rigorous standards.” 
Many American physicians were in fact enthralled by the laboratory 
advances being made in Europe. But they had to go to Europe to learn 
them. Upon their return they could do little or nothing with their knowl-
edge. Not a single institution in the United States supported any medical 
research whatsoever. 
As one American who had studied in Europe wrote, “I was often asked 
in Germany how it is that no scientiﬁc work in medicine is done in this 
country, how it is that many good men who do well in Germany and 
show evident talent there are never heard of and never do any good work 
when they come back here. The answer is that there is no opportunity for, 
no appreciation of, no demand for that kind of work here. . . .  The con-
dition of medical education here is simply horrible.” 
In 1873, Johns Hopkins died, leaving behind a trust of $3.5 million to 
found a university and hospital. It was to that time the greatest gift ever 
to a university. Princeton’s library collection was then an embarrassment 
of only a few books—and the library was open only one hour a week. 
Columbia was little better: its library opened for two hours each after-
noon, but freshmen could not enter without a special permission slip. 
Only 10 percent of Harvard’s professors had a Ph.D. 
The trustees of Hopkins’s estate were Quakers who moved deliber-
ately but also decisively. Against the advice of Harvard president Charles 
Eliot, Yale president James Burril Angell, and Cornell president Andrew 
D. White, they decided to model the Johns Hopkins University after the 
greatest German universities, places thick with men consumed with cre-
ating new knowledge, not simply teaching what was believed. 
"
"34 
The Great Influenza 
The trustees made this decision precisely because there was no such 
university in America, and precisely because they recognized the need 
after doing the equivalent of market research. A board member later 
explained, “There was a strong demand, among the young men of this 
country, for opportunities to study beyond the ordinary courses of a college 
or a scientiﬁc school. . . .  The strongest evidence of this demand was the 
increased attendance of American students upon lectures of German uni-
versities.” The trustees decided that quality would sell. They intended to hire 
only eminent professors and provide opportunities for advanced study. 
Their plan was in many ways an entirely American ambition: to cre-
ate a revolution from nothing. For it made little sense to locate the new 
institution in Baltimore, a squalid industrial and port city. Unlike 
Philadelphia, Boston, or New York, it had no tradition of philanthropy, 
no social elite ready to lead, and certainly no intellectual tradition. Even 
the architecture of Baltimore seemed exceptionally dreary, long lines of 
row houses, each with three steps, crowding against the street and yet vir-
tually no street life—the people of Baltimore seemed to live inward, in 
backyards and courtyards. 
In fact, there was no base whatsoever upon which to build . . . except  
the money, another American trait. 
The trustees hired as president Daniel Coit Gilman, who left the pres-
idency of the newly organized University of California after disputes with 
state legislators. Earlier he had helped create and had led the Shefﬁeld 
Scientiﬁc School at Yale, which was distinct from Yale itself. Indeed, it was 
created partly because of Yale’s reluctance to embrace science as part of 
its basic curriculum. 
At the Hopkins, Gilman immediately recruited an internationally 
respected—and connected—faculty, which gave it instant credibility. In 
Europe, people like Huxley saw the Hopkins as combining the explosive 
energy and openness of America with the grit of science; the potential 
could shake the world. 
To honor the Hopkins upon its beginnings, to honor this vision, to 
proselytize upon this new faith, Thomas Huxley came to America. 
The Johns Hopkins would have rigor. It would have such rigor as no 
school in America had ever known. 
The Hopkins opened in 1876. Its medical school would not open 
until 1893, but it succeeded so brilliantly and quickly that, by the out-

break of World War I, American medical science had caught up to Europe 
and was about to surpass it. 
Inﬂuenza is a viral disease. When it kills, it usually does so in one of two 
ways: either quickly and directly with a violent viral pneumonia so dam-
aging that it has been compared to burning the lungs; or more slowly and 
indirectly by stripping the body of defenses, allowing bacteria to invade 
the lungs and cause a more common and slower-killing bacterial pneu-
monia. 
By World War I, those trained directly or indirectly by the Hopkins 
already did lead the world in investigating pneumonia, a disease referred 
to as “the captain of the men of death.” They could in some instances pre-
vent it and cure it. 
And their story begins with one man.

othing about the boyhood or youth of William Henry Welch 
suggested his future. 
So it is apt that the best biography of him begins not with his child-
hood but with an extraordinary eightieth-birthday celebration in 1930. 
Friends, colleagues, and admirers gathered for the event not only in Bal-
timore, where he lived, but in Boston, in New York, in Washington; in 
Chicago, Cincinnati, and Los Angeles; in Paris, London, Geneva, Tokyo, 
and Peking. Telegraph and radio linked the celebrations, and their 
starting times were staggered to allow as much overlap as time zones 
made possible. The many halls were thick with scientists in many ﬁelds, 
including Nobel laureates, and President Herbert Hoover’s tribute to 
Welch at the Washington event was broadcast live over American radio 
networks. 
The tribute was to a man who had become arguably the single most 
inﬂuential scientist in the world. He had served as president of the 
National Academy of Sciences, president of the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science, president of the American Medical Associ-
ation, and president or dominant ﬁgure of literally dozens of other scien-
tiﬁc groups. At a time when no government funds went to research, as 
both chairman of the Executive Committee of the Carnegie Institution of 
Washington and president—for thirty-two years—of the Board of Scien-
tiﬁc Directors of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now 
"
"37 
The Warriors 
Rockefeller University), he had also directed the ﬂow of money from the 
two greatest philanthropic organizations in the country. 
And yet Welch had been no great pioneer even in his own ﬁeld of 
medical research—no Louis Pasteur, no Robert Koch, no Paul Ehrlich, no 
Theobald Smith. He had generated no brilliant insights, made no mag-
niﬁcent discoveries, asked no deep and original questions, and left no 
signiﬁcant legacy in the laboratory or in scientiﬁc papers. He did little 
work—a reasonable judge might say he did no work—so profound as to 
merit even membership in, much less the presidency of, the National 
Academy of Sciences. 
Nonetheless, these hundreds of the world’s leading scientists had 
measured him as coldly and objectively as they measured everything and 
found him worthy. They had gathered to celebrate his life, if not for his 
science then for what he had done for science. 
In his lifetime the world had changed radically, from horse and buggy 
to radio, airplanes, even the ﬁrst television. Coca-Cola had been invented 
and rapidly spread across the country before 1900, by the 1920s Wool-
worth’s had over ﬁfteen hundred stores, and a technocratic makeover of 
America had accompanied the Progressive Age, culminating in 1930 in a 
White House conference on children that proclaimed the superiority of 
experts to parents in child raising, because “it is beyond the capacity of an 
individual parent to train her child to ﬁt into the intricate, interwoven, 
and interdependent social and economic system we have developed.” 
Welch had of course played no role in those changes. But he had 
played a large and direct role in an equivalent makeover of medicine and 
especially American medicine. 
He had served ﬁrst as a kind of avatar, his own experience embodying 
and epitomizing that of many in his generation. Yet he was no simple 
symbol or representative. Like an Escher drawing, his life both repre-
sented that of others and simultaneously deﬁned the lives of those who 
followed him, and those who followed them, and those who followed 
them, down to the present. 
For if he did no revolutionary science, he lived a revolutionary life. He 
was personality and theater; he was impresario, creator, builder. Like an 
actor on a live stage, his life was a performance given once, leaving its 
impact upon his audience, and only through them echoing in time and 
place. He led the movement that created the greatest scientiﬁc medical 
"

enterprise, and possibly the greatest enterprise in any of the sciences, in 
the world. His legacy was not objectively measurable, but it was nonethe-
less real. It lay in his ability to stir other men’s souls. 
Welch was born in 1850 in Norfolk, Connecticut, a small town in the 
northern part of the state that remains even today a hilly and wooded 
retreat. His grandfather, great-uncle, father, and four uncles were physi-
cians. His father also served a term in Congress and in 1857 addressed the 
graduates of Yale Medical School. In that speech he demonstrated a sig-
niﬁcant grasp of the latest medical developments, including a technique 
that would not be mentioned at Harvard until 1868 and the striking new 
“cell theory with its results in physiology and pathology,” a reference to 
the work of Rudolf Virchow, who had then published only in German-
language journals. He also declared, “All positive knowledge obtained . . .  
has resulted from the accurate observation of facts.” 
Yet if it seemed foreordained that Welch would become a physician, 
this was not the case. Years later he told the great surgeon Harvey Cush-
ing, a protégé, that in his youth medicine had ﬁlled him with repugnance. 
Perhaps part of that repugnance came from his circumstances. 
Welch’s mother died when he was six months old. His sister, three years 
older, was sent away, and his father was distant both emotionally and 
physically. Throughout Welch’s life he would be closer to his sister than to 
any other living soul; over the years their correspondence revealed what 
intimacies he was willing to share. 
His childhood was marked by what would become a pattern through-
out his life: loneliness masked by social activity. At ﬁrst he sought to ﬁt in. 
He was not isolated. Neighbors included an uncle and cousins his age 
with whom he played routinely, but he longed for greater intimacy and 
begged his cousins to call him “brother.” They refused. Elsewhere, too, he 
sought to ﬁt in, to belong. At the age of ﬁfteen, submitting to evangelical 
fervor, he formally committed himself to God. 
He attended Yale where he found no conﬂict between his religious 
commitment and science. While the college had begun teaching such 
practical arts as engineering, it kept a measured distance from the scientiﬁc 
ferment of these years immediately following the Civil War, purposely 
setting itself up as a conservative, Congregationalist counterbalance to 
the Unitarian inﬂuence at Harvard. But if Welch’s intellectual interests 
"
"39 
The Warriors 
developed only after college, his personality had already formed. Three 
attributes in particular stood out. Their combination would prove pow-
erful indeed. 
His intelligence did shine through, and he graduated third in his class. 
But the impression left on others came not from his brilliance but from 
his personality. He had the unusual ability to simultaneously involve 
himself passionately in something yet retain perspective. One student 
described him as “the only one who kept cool” during heated discussions, 
and he would carry this trait through the rest of his life. 
There was something about him that made others want him to think 
well of them. Hazing of freshmen was brutal at the time, so brutal that a 
classmate was advised to keep a pistol in his room to prevent sophomores 
from abusing him. Yet Welch was left entirely alone. Skull and Bones, per-
haps the single most secret society in the United States, which marks its 
members powerfully with the embrace of the establishment, inducted 
him, and he would remain deeply attached to Bones his entire life. Per-
haps that satisﬁed his desire to belong. At any rate, his earlier desperation 
to ﬁt in was replaced by a self-sufﬁciency. His roommate on parting left 
him an extraordinary note: “I ought to try to express my great indebted-
ness for the kindness which you always manifested toward me, the pure 
example you set me, . . . I feel now more deeply the truth of what I often 
said to others if not to you—that I was utterly unworthy of such a chum 
as yourself. I often pitied you, to think that you had to room with me, 
your inferior in ability, dignity and every noble and good quality.” 
It is the kind of note that a biographer might interpret as homoerotic. 
Perhaps it was. At least one other man would later devote himself to 
Welch with what could only be called ardor. Yet for the rest of Welch’s life 
he also seemed somehow, in some indeﬁnable way, to generate similar if 
less intense sentiments in others. He did so without effort. He charmed 
without effort. He inspired without effort. And he did so without his 
reciprocating any personal connection, much less attachment. A later age 
would call this “charisma.” 
His class rank entitled him to give an oration at commencement. In 
an undergraduate essay entitled “The Decay of Faith,” Welch had decried 
mechanistic science, which viewed the world as a machine “unguided by 
a God of justice.” Now, in 1870, the year after Darwin published Origin of 
Species, in his oration Welch attempted to reconcile science and religion. 
"
"40 
The Great Influenza 
He found it a difﬁcult task. Science is at all times potentially revolu-
tionary; any new answer to a seemingly mundane question about “how” 
something occurs may uncover chains of causation that throw all pre-
ceding order into disarray and that threaten religious beliefs as well. 
Welch personally was experiencing the pains that many in the last half of 
the nineteenth century experienced for the ﬁrst time as adults as science 
threatened to supplant the natural order, God’s order, with an order 
deﬁned by mankind, an order that promised no one knew what, an order 
that, as Milton wrote in Paradise Lost, “Frighted the reign of Chaos and 
old night.” 
Taking a step backward from what his father had said a dozen years 
before, Welch rejected the personal God of Emerson and the Unitarians, 
reiterated the importance of revealed truth in Scripture, argued that rev-
elation need not submit to reason, and spoke of that which “man could 
never discover by the light of his own mind.” 
Welch would ultimately devote his life to discovering all the world 
with his own mind, and to spurring others to do the same. But not yet. 
He had studied classics and he had hoped to teach Greek at Yale. Yale did 
not, however, offer him a position, and he became a tutor at a new private 
school. That school closed, Yale still offered him nothing, and, with no 
immediate prospects for employment, with his family importuning him 
to become a physician, he returned to Norfolk and apprenticed to his 
father. 
It was an old-fashioned practice. Nothing his father did reﬂected his 
knowledge of the newest medical concepts. Like most American physi-
cians, he ignored objective measurements such as temperature and blood 
pressure, and he even mixed prescriptions without measuring dosages, 
often relying on taste. This apprenticeship was not a happy time for Welch. 
In his own later accounts of his training, he passed over it as if it had 
never occurred. But sometime during it his views of medicine changed. 
At some point he decided that if he was going to become a physician, 
he would do so in his own way. Routinely those preparing for medicine 
apprenticed for six months or a year, and then attended medical school. 
He had served his apprenticeship. But in the next step he took he marked 
out a new course. Welch returned to school all right, but he did not 
attend medical school. He learned chemistry. 
"
"41 
The Warriors 
Not only did no medical school in the United States require entering 
students to have either any scientiﬁc knowledge or a college degree, nei-
ther did any American medical school emphasize science. Far from it. In 
1871, a senior professor at the Harvard Medical School argued, “In an age 
of science, like the present, there is more danger that the average medical 
student will be drawn from what is practical, useful, and even essential by 
the well-meant enthusiasm of the votaries of the applicable sciences, than 
that he will suffer from the want of knowledge of these. . . . [We]  should 
not encourage the medical student to while away his time in the laby-
rinths of Chemistry and Physiology.” 
Welch had a different view. Chemistry seemed to him a window into 
the body. By then Carl Ludwig, later Welch’s mentor, and several other 
leading German scientists had met in Berlin and determined to “consti-
tute physiology on a chemico-physical foundation and give it equal sci-
entiﬁc rank with physics.” 
It was highly unlikely that Welch knew of that determination, but his 
instincts were the same. In 1872 he entered Yale’s Shefﬁeld Scientiﬁc 
School to study chemistry. He considered the facilities there “excellent . . .  
certainly better than in any medical school, where chemistry as far as I 
can learn is very much slighted.” 
After half a year of grounding, he began medical school at the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, which was not yet con-
nected to Columbia University. (He disdained Yale’s medical school; ﬁfty 
years later he was asked to give a speech on Yale’s early contributions to 
medicine and replied that there hadn’t been any.) It was a typical good 
American medical school, with no requirements for admission and no 
grades in any course. As elsewhere, faculty salaries came directly from 
student fees, so faculty wanted to maximize the number of students. 
Instruction came almost entirely through lectures; the school offered no 
laboratory work of any kind. This, too, was typical. In no American 
school did students use a microscope. In fact, Welch’s work in one course 
won him the great prize of a microscope; he cherished it but did not 
know how to use it, and no professor offered to instruct him. Instead he 
enviously watched them work, commenting, “I can only admire without 
understanding how to use its apparently complicated mechanism.” 
But unlike in many other schools, students at the College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons could examine cadavers. Pathological anatomy— 
"
"42 
The Great Influenza 
using autopsies to decipher what was happening within organs— 
enthralled Welch. New York City had three medical schools. He took the 
course in pathological anatomy at all three. 
Then he completed his school’s single requirement for an M.D. He 
passed a ﬁnal examination. Welch called it “the easiest examination I ever 
entered since leaving boarding school.” 
Shortly before Welch took this test, Yale ﬁnally offered him the position 
he had so earnestly sought earlier—professor of Greek. He declined it. 
To his father he wrote, “I have chosen my profession, am becoming 
more and more interested in it, and do not feel at all inclined to relin-
quish it for anything else.” 
He was interested indeed. 
He was also beginning to be recognized. Francis Delaﬁeld, one of his pro-
fessors, had studied pathological anatomy in Paris with Pierre Louis and, 
like Louis, kept detailed records of hundreds of autopsies. Delaﬁeld’s was 
the best work in America, the most precise, the most scientiﬁc. Delaﬁeld 
now brought Welch into his fold and allowed him the extraordinary priv-
ilege of entering his own autopsy ﬁndings into Delaﬁeld’s sacred notes. 
Yet huge gaps in Welch’s knowledge remained. He still did not know 
how to use his microscope. Delaﬁeld, an expert in microscopic technique 
who had made his own microtome (a device for cutting exquisitely thin 
slices of tissue), would sit for hours with one eye glued to the lens, smok-
ing a pipe, while Welch watched impotently. But Delaﬁeld did let Welch 
perform a huge number of autopsies for someone in his junior position. 
From each one he tried to learn. 
That knowledge did not satisfy him. His best professors had studied 
in Paris, Vienna, and Berlin. Although Welch still intended to practice 
clinical medicine—not a single physician in the United States then made 
a living doing research—he borrowed from family and friends and, having 
run through all that his American professors could teach him, on April 
19, 1876, a few months before Huxley spoke at the inauguration of the 
Johns Hopkins University, Welch sailed for Europe to continue his scien-
tiﬁc education. Simon Flexner, Welch’s protégé and a brilliant scientist in 
his own right, declared this trip “a voyage of exploration that was in its 
results perhaps the most important ever taken by an American doctor.”

He was hardly alone in seeking more knowledge in Germany, where the 
best science was then being done. One historian has estimated that 
between 1870 and 1914, ﬁfteen thousand American doctors studied in 
Germany or Austria, along with thousands more from England, France, 
Japan, Turkey, Italy, and Russia. 
The overwhelming majority of these physicians were interested solely in 
treating patients. In Vienna professors established a virtual assembly line 
to teach short courses on speciﬁc aspects of clinical medicine to foreign 
doctors, especially Americans. These Americans took the courses partly out 
of desire to learn and partly to gain an edge over competitors at home. 
Welch himself expected to have to practice medicine to make a living, 
and he recognized how helpful to such a career studying in Germany 
could be. He assured his sister and brother-in-law as well as his father, all 
of whom were helping support him ﬁnancially, “The prestige and knowl-
edge which I should acquire by a year’s study in Germany would decid-
edly increase my chance of success. The young doctors who are doing 
well in New York are in a large majority those who have studied abroad.” 
But his real interest lay with the tiny minority of Americans who went 
to Germany to explore a new universe. He wanted to learn laboratory sci-
ence. In America he had already acquired a reputation as knowing far 
more than his colleagues. In Germany he was refused acceptance into two 
laboratories because he knew so little. This inspired rather than depressed 
him. Soon he found a place to start and excitedly wrote home, “I feel as if 
I were only just initiated into the great science of medicine. My previous 
experiences compared with the present are like the difference between 
reading of a fair country and seeing it with one’s own eyes. To live in the 
atmosphere of these scientiﬁc workshops and laboratories, to come into 
contact with the men who have formed and are forming the science of 
today, to have the opportunity of doing a little original investigation 
myself are all advantages, which, if they do not prove fruitful in later life, 
will always be to me a source of pleasure and proﬁt.” 
Of Leipzig’s university, he said, “If you could visit the handsome and 
thoroughly equipped physiological, anatomical, pathological and chemi-
cal laboratories and see professors whose fame is already world-wide, 
with their corps of assistants and students hard at work, you would real-
ize how by concentration of labor and devotion to study Germany has 
outstripped other countries in the science of medicine.” 
"

The Great Influenza 
He focused on learning how to learn and stayed constantly alert to 
technique, to anything offering another window into the new world, any-
thing that allowed him to see more clearly and deeply. “The chief value” 
of his work with one scientist was “in teaching me certain important meth-
ods of handling fresh tissues, especially in isolating particular elements.” 
Of another scientist whom he disliked, he said, “What is of greater impor-
tance, I have acquired a knowledge of methods of preparing and mount-
ing specimens so that I can carry on investigations hereafter.” 
By now he was attracting attention from his mentors, who included 
some of the leading scientists in the world, but they left a more distinct 
impression upon him. One was Carl Ludwig, whom he called “my ideal 
of a scientiﬁc man, accepting nothing upon authority, but putting every 
scientiﬁc theory to the severest test. . . . I hope I have  learned from Pro-
fessor Ludwig’s precept and practice that most important lesson for every 
man of science, not to be satisﬁed with loose thinking and half-proofs, 
not to speculate and theorize but to observe closely and carefully.” 
Julius Cohnheim, another mentor, taught him a new kind of curiosity: 
“Cohnheim’s interest centers on the explanation of the fact. It is not enough 
for him to know that congestion of the kidney follows heart disease. . . .  
He is constantly inquiring why does it occur under these circum-
stances. . . . He is  almost the founder and certainly the chief representa-
tive of the so-called experimental or physiological school of pathology.” 
Welch began to analyze everything, including his most deeply held 
beliefs. Five years earlier he had condemned the concept of a world ruled 
other than by a God of justice. Now he told his father that he embraced 
Darwin: “That there is anything irreligious about the doctrine of evolu-
tion I cannot see. . . . In  the end our preconceived beliefs must change 
and adapt themselves. The facts of science never will change.” 
He also analyzed the means by which German science had achieved 
such stature. Its three most important elements, he decided, were the 
thorough preparation required of students by German medical schools, 
the schools’ independent ﬁnancing, and the support of research by the 
government and universities. 
In 1877, a year after the Johns Hopkins University opened, its president, 
Daniel Gilman, laid plans to assemble the greatest medical school fac-
ulty in America, one to rival any in Europe. The decision to launch a 
"
"45 
The Warriors 
national—indeed international—search was itself revolutionary. With 
the exception of the University of Michigan, located in tiny Ann Arbor, 
every medical school in the United States ﬁlled its faculty exclusively 
from the ranks of local physicians. To perform the search Gilman chose 
the perfect man: Dr. John Shaw Billings. 
Billings lay behind America’s ﬁrst great contribution to scientiﬁc 
medicine: a library. This library grew out of the detailed medical history 
of the Civil War ordered by the army surgeon general. The army also cre-
ated a medical “museum,” which was actually a library of specimens. 
Both the museum and the history were remarkable. In 1998 scientists 
at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, a direct descendant of this 
museum, used specimens preserved in 1918 to determine the genetic 
makeup of the 1918 inﬂuenza virus. And the medical history was 
extraordinarily precise and useful. Even Virchow said he was “constantly 
astonished at the wealth of experience therein found. The greatest exact-
ness in detail, careful statistics even in the smallest matters, and a schol-
arly statement embracing all sides of medical experience are here united.” 
Billings did not write that history, but it did inspire him to create a 
medical library of comparable quality. He built what one medical histo-
rian judged “probably the greatest and most useful medical library in the 
world.” By 1876 it already held eighty thousand volumes; ultimately it 
grew into today’s National Library of Medicine. 
But he did more than collect books and articles. Knowledge is useless 
unless accessible. To disseminate knowledge, Billings developed a cata-
loging system far superior to any in Europe, and he began publishing the 
Index Medicus, a monthly bibliography of new medical books and articles 
appearing in the Americas, Europe, Japan. No comparable bibliography 
existed anywhere else in the world. 
And no one else in the world had a better sense of what was going on 
in all the world’s laboratories than Billings. 
He traveled to Europe to meet possible candidates for the Hopkins 
faculty, including established scientists of international renown. But he 
also sought out young men, the next generation of leaders. He had heard 
of Welch, heard of his potential, heard that he had exposed himself not to 
one or two of the great scientists but to many, heard that he seemed to 
know everyone in Germany, including—even before they emerged as 
arguably the two greatest medical scientists of the nineteenth or early 
"
"46 
The Great Influenza 
twentieth century—Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich. (In fact, when Koch, 
then unknown, ﬁrst made his dramatic demonstration of the life cycle of 
anthrax, Welch was in the same laboratory.) 
Billings met with Welch in an ancient Leipzig beer hall, a hall that 
itself belonged to myth. On the wall were murals depicting the sixteenth-
century meeting of Faust and the Devil, for the meeting had supposedly 
occurred in that very room. Billings and Welch talked passionately of sci-
ence deep into the night, while the murals endowed their words with 
conspiratorial irony. Billings spoke of the plans for the Hopkins: unheard-
of admission standards for students, labs that ﬁlled great buildings, the 
most modern hospital in the world, and of course a brilliant faculty. They 
talked also about life, about each other’s goals. Welch knew perfectly well 
he was being interviewed. In response, he opened his soul. 
After the dinner Billings told Francis King, president of the yet-to-be-
built Johns Hopkins Hospital, that Welch “should be one of the ﬁrst men 
to be secured, when the time came.” 
That time would not come for a while. The Hopkins had begun as a grad-
uate school only, without even any undergraduate students, although it 
quickly expanded to include a college. Further expansion abruptly be-
came problematic since its endowment was chieﬂy in Baltimore & Ohio 
Railroad stock. The country had been wallowing in depression for four 
years when the B&O and the Pennsylvania Railroad cut wages 10 percent, 
sparking violent strikes by railroad workers in Maryland that soon spread 
to Pittsburgh, Chicago, St. Louis, and farther west. B&O stock collapsed, 
and the plans to open the medical school had to be put off. There were no 
new faculty posts at the Hopkins to ﬁll. 
So in 1877 Welch returned to New York desperate for “some opportu-
nity” in science “and at the same time making a modest livelihood.” Fail-
ing to ﬁnd one, he returned to Europe. In 1878 he was back in New York. 
At no time in history had medicine been advancing so rapidly. The 
thousands who ﬂocked to Europe were proof of American physicians’ 
intense interest in those advances. Yet in the United States neither Welch 
nor anyone else could support himself by either joining in that great 
march or teaching what had been learned. 
Welch proposed to a former mentor at the College of Physicians and 
Surgeons that he teach a laboratory course. The school had no laboratory 
"
"47 
The Warriors 
and wanted none. No medical school in the United States used a labora-
tory for instruction. The school rejected his suggestion but did offer to let 
Welch lecture—without salary—in pathology. 
Welch turned to Bellevue, a medical school with a lesser reputation. It 
let him offer his course and provided three rooms for it, equipped only 
with empty kitchen tables. There were no microscopes, no glassware, no 
incubators, no instruments. Facing the empty rooms, discouraged, he 
wrote, “I cannot make much of a success out of the affair at present. I 
seem to be thrown entirely upon my own resources for equipping the 
laboratory and do not think that I can accomplish much.” 
He was also worried. His entire compensation would come from stu-
dent fees, and the three-month course was not required. He conﬁded to 
his sister, “I sometimes feel rather blue when I look ahead and see that I 
am not going to be able to realize my aspirations in life. . . . There is no  
opportunity in this country, and it seems unlikely there ever will be. . . . I  
can teach microscopy and pathology, perhaps get some practice and 
make a living after a while, but that is all patchwork and the drudgery of 
life and what hundreds do.” 
He was wrong. 
In fact he would catalyze the creation of an entire generation of sci-
entists who would transform American medicine, scientists who would 
confront inﬂuenza in 1918, scientists whose ﬁndings from that epidemic 
still echo today. 
"

elch’s course quickly became extraordinarily popular. Soon 
students from all three of New York City’s medical schools were 
lining up for it, attracted as Welch had been to this new science, to the 
microscope, to experimentation. And Welch did not simply teach; he 
inspired. His comments always seemed so solid, well grounded, well rea-
soned. A colleague observed, “He would leak knowledge.” And the excite-
ment! Each time a student ﬁxed a specimen on a slide and looked 
through a microscope, an entire universe opened to him! To some, dis-
covering that universe, entering into it, beginning to manipulate it, was 
akin to creating it; they must have felt almost godlike. 
The College of Physicians and Surgeons had to offer a laboratory 
course to compete. It beseeched Welch to teach it. He declined out of loyalty 
to Bellevue but recommended the hiring of T. Mitchell Prudden, an Amer-
ican he had known—and considered a rival for the Hopkins job—in 
Europe. It was the ﬁrst of what would be uncounted job offers that he 
engineered. Meanwhile one of his students recalled “his serious, eager 
look, his smiling face, his interest in young men which bound them to him. 
He was always ready to drop any work in which he was engaged and answer 
even trivial questions on any subject—in fact he was never without an 
answer for his knowledge was encyclopedic. I felt instinctively that he was 
wasted at Bellevue, and was destined to have a larger circle of hearers.” 
"
"49 
The Warriors 
But despite the throngs of motivated students taking the two courses, 
neither Prudden nor Welch prospered. Two years went by, then three, 
then four. To cobble together a living, Welch did autopsies at a state hos-
pital, served as an assistant to a prominent physician, and tutored med-
ical students before their ﬁnal exams. As he passed his thirtieth birthday 
he was doing no real science. He was making a reputation and it was clear 
if he chose to concentrate on practice he could become wealthy. Little 
medical research was being done in America—although the little that was 
done was signiﬁcant—but even that little he had no part of. In Europe 
science was marching from advance to advance, breakthrough to break-
through. The most important of these was the germ theory of disease. 
Proving and elaborating upon the germ theory would ultimately open 
the way to confronting all infectious disease. It would also create the con-
ceptual framework and technical tools that Welch and others later used 
to ﬁght inﬂuenza. 
Simply put, the germ theory said that minute living organisms 
invaded the body, multiplied, and caused disease, and that a speciﬁc germ 
caused a speciﬁc disease. 
There was need for a new theory of disease. As the nineteenth century 
progressed, as autopsy ﬁndings were correlated with symptoms reported 
during life, as organs from animals and cadavers were put under a micro-
scope, as normal organs were compared to diseased ones, as diseases 
became more deﬁned, localized, and speciﬁc, scientists ﬁnally discarded 
the ideas of systemic illness and the humours of Hippocrates and Galen 
and began looking for better explanations. 
Three theories stood as rivals to the germ theory. 
The ﬁrst involved “miasma.” Several variations of this concept existed, 
but they basically argued that many diseases were caused by some kind of 
putrefaction in the atmosphere, or by some climactic inﬂuence, or by 
noxious fumes from decaying organic materials. (In China the wind was 
originally regarded as a demon that caused illness.) Miasmas seemed a 
particularly good explanation of epidemics, and the unhealthiness of 
swamp regions seemed to support the theory. In 1885, when Welch con-
sidered the germ theory as proven, the New York City Board of Health 
warned that “laying of all telegraph wires under ground in one season . . .  
"
"50 
The Great Influenza 
would prove highly detrimental to the health of the city . . . through the 
exposure to the atmosphere of so much subsoil, saturated, as most of it is, 
with noxious gases. . . . Harlem  Flats [had] a sufﬁcient supply of rotting 
ﬁlth to generate fetid gases adequate to the poisoning of half the popula-
tion.” As late as the 1930s one prominent and highly regarded British epi-
demiologist continued to advocate the miasma theory, and after the 1918 
inﬂuenza pandemic, climatic conditions were scrutinized in a search for 
correlations. 
The “ﬁlth” theory of disease was almost a corollary of the miasma the-
ory. It also suited Victorian mores perfectly. Fear of “swamp gas”—often 
a euphemism for the smells of fecal matter—and installation of indoor 
toilets were all part of the Victorian drive to improve sanitation and 
simultaneously to separate the human body from anything Victorians 
found distasteful. And ﬁlth often is associated with disease: lice carry 
typhus; contaminated water spreads typhoid and cholera; rats through 
their ﬂeas spread plague. 
Both the miasma and ﬁlth theories had sophisticated adherents, in-
cluding public health ofﬁcials and some extremely gifted scientists, but 
the most scientiﬁc rival of the germ theory explained disease in terms 
purely of chemistry. It saw disease as a chemical process. This theory had 
much to recommend it. 
Not only had scientists used chemistry as a lens that brought much of 
biology into focus, but some chemical reactions seemed to mimic the 
actions of disease. For example, advocates of the chemical theory of disease 
argued that ﬁre was a chemical process and a single match could set off 
a chain reaction that ignited an entire forest or city. They hypothesized 
that chemicals they called “zymes” acted like a match. A zyme started a 
series of chemical reactions in the body that could launch the equivalent of 
fermentation—infection. (The chemical theory of disease, without the 
name, has in fact largely been validated. Scientists have clearly demon-
strated that chemicals, radiation, and environmental factors can cause 
disease, although usually only through long-term or massive exposure 
and not, as the zymote theory hypothesized, by suddenly igniting a cascade 
of reactions.) 
Ultimately this theory evolved to suggest that zymes could reproduce 
in the body; thus they acted as both catalysts and living organisms. In 
"
"51 
The Warriors 
fact, this more sophisticated version of the zymote theory essentially 
describes what is today called a virus. 
Yet these theories left many scientists unsatisﬁed. Disease often 
seemed to germinate, grow, and spread. Did there not then have to be a 
point of origin, a seed? Jacob Henle in his 1840 essay “On Miasmata and 
Contagia” ﬁrst formulated the modern germ theory; he also offered evi-
dence for the theory and laid out criteria that, if met, would prove it. 
Then, in 1860, Pasteur proved that living organisms, not a chemical 
chain reaction, caused fermentation, winning converts to the germ the-
ory. The most important early convert was Joseph Lister, who immedi-
ately applied these ﬁndings to surgery, instituting antiseptic conditions in 
the operating room and slashing the percentage of patients who died 
from infections after surgery. 
But the work of Robert Koch was most compelling. Koch himself was 
compelling. The son of an engineer, brilliant enough to teach himself to 
read at age ﬁve, he studied under Henle, was offered research posts, but 
became a clinician to support his family. He did not, however, stop inves-
tigating nature. Working alone, he conducted a series of experiments that 
met the most rigid tests and discovered the complete life cycle of the 
anthrax bacillus, showing that it formed spores that could lie dormant in 
the soil for years. In 1876 he walked into the laboratory of Ferdinand Cohn, 
one of Welch’s mentors, and presented his ﬁndings. They brought him 
instant fame. 
He subsequently laid down what came to be known as “Koch’s postu-
lates,” although Henle had earlier proposed much the same thing. The 
postulates state that before a microorganism can be said to cause a given 
disease, ﬁrst, investigators had to ﬁnd the germ in every case of the dis-
ease; second, they had to isolate the germ in pure culture; third, they had 
to inoculate a susceptible animal with the germ and the animal then had 
to get the disease; and, fourth, the germ had to be isolated from the test 
animal. Koch’s postulates became a standard almost immediately. (Meet-
ing the standard is not simple; ﬁnding a test animal that suffered the 
same symptoms as humans when infected with a human pathogen, for 
example, is not always possible.) 
In 1882 Koch’s discovery of the tubercle bacillus, the cause of tuber-
culosis, shook the scientiﬁc world and further conﬁrmed the germ theory. 
"
"52 
The Great Influenza 
Tuberculosis was a killer. Laymen called it “consumption,” and that name 
spoke to the awfulness of the disease. It consumed people. Like cancer, it 
attacked the young as well as the old, sucked the life out of them, turned 
them into cachectic shells, and then killed them. 
It would be difﬁcult to overstate the importance of Koch’s discovery 
to the believers in bacteriology. In New York, one of Welch’s friends came 
running into his bedroom with a newspaper account of the discovery. 
Welch jumped out of bed and together they rushed to tell another 
friend. Almost immediately afterward, Welch felt the excitement directly. 
He demonstrated Koch’s discovery to his class, copying Koch’s method, 
his class watching steam rise from the plate while he stained sputum from 
a consumption patient with carbol-fuchsin, the stain binding to the 
bacillus so that it became visible on a slide. Here was the newest and 
greatest of discoveries! Students looked at the slide through the micro-
scope, saw what Koch had seen, and were electriﬁed, many recalling the 
moment vividly years later. One of those students was Hermann Biggs, 
who became a giant in his own right; at that moment he decided to spend 
his life in bacteriology. 
But for Welch, reproducing Koch’s ﬁnding must have been bitter-
sweet. He knew the Germans, knew nearly all of these men adventuring 
into the unknowns of science. Yet here he was only keeping track of their 
work, doing none himself. 
Then, in 1883, Koch achieved the ﬁrst great triumph of science over 
disease. Earlier in the nineteenth century, two cholera epidemics had 
devastated Europe and the United States. As a new epidemic in Egypt 
threatened the borders of Europe, France dispatched investigators in this 
new ﬁeld of bacteriology to track down the cause of the disease. Germany 
dispatched Koch. 
Before this, medicine’s great successes had come about almost serendip-
itously, beginning with an observation. With smallpox Jenner started out 
by taking seriously the experiences of country folk inoculating them-
selves. But not here. In this case the target had been ﬁxed in advance. 
Both the French and Koch rationally designed an approach, then turned 
the general tools of the laboratory and bacteriology to a particular target. 
The French failed. Louis Thuillier, the youngest member of the expe-
dition, died of cholera. Despite the bitter and nationalistic rivalry between 
Pasteur and Koch, Koch returned with the body to France and served as 
"
"53 
The Warriors 
pallbearer at Thuillier’s funeral, dropping into the grave a laurel wreath 
“such as are given to the brave.” 
Koch then returned to Egypt, isolated the cholera bacillus, and fol-
lowed it to India to explore his ﬁndings in greater depth. John Snow’s ear-
lier epidemiological study in London had proved only to some that 
contaminated water caused the disease. Now, in conjunction with Koch’s 
evidence, the germ theory seemed proven in cholera—and by implica-
tion the germ theory itself seemed proven. 
Most leading physicians around the world, including in the United 
States, agreed with a prominent American public health expert who 
declared in 1885: “What was theory has become fact.” 
But a minority, both in the United States and Europe, still resisted the 
germ theory, believing that Pasteur, Koch, and others had proven that 
germs existed but not that germs caused disease—or at least that they 
were the sole cause of disease.* 
The most notable critic was Max von Pettenkofer, who had made real 
and major scientiﬁc contributions. He insisted that Koch’s bacteria were 
only one of many factors in the causation of cholera. His dispute with 
Koch became increasingly bitter and passionate. With a touch of both 
Barnum and a tightrope walker about him, Pettenkofer, determined to 
prove himself right, prepared test tubes thick with lethal cholera bacte-
ria. Then he and several of his students drank them down. Amazingly, 
although two students developed minor cases of cholera, all survived. 
Pettenkofer claimed victory, and vindication. 
It was a costly claim. In 1892 cholera contaminated the water supply 
of Hamburg and Altona, a smaller adjacent city. Altona ﬁltered the water, 
and its citizens escaped the disease; Hamburg did not ﬁlter the water, and 
there 8,606 people died of cholera. Pettenkofer became not only a 
mocked but a reviled ﬁgure. He later committed suicide. 
There was still no cure for cholera, but now science had demonstrated— 
*The critics made some valid points. Clearly the attacking organism does not 
entirely determine whether someone gets sick. The same organism can attack two 
people, kill one, and not cause any symptoms in the other. An individual’s genes, 
immune system, environment, and even such factors as stress all affect susceptibility. 
As late as 1911 the head of the school training French army doctors in public 
health said that germs alone were “powerless to create an epidemic.” But that particu-
lar view was by then an idiosyncratic, not simply minority, opinion. 
"
"54 
The Great Influenza 
the dead in Hamburg were the ﬁnal evidence—that protecting the water 
supply and testing for the bacteria would prevent the disease. After that 
only an isolated and discredited group of recalcitrants continued to reject 
the germ theory. 
By then Welch had arrived at the Hopkins. It had not been an easy 
journey to Baltimore. 
When the offer ﬁnally came in 1884, Welch had become comfortable in 
New York, and wealth was his for the asking. Virtually every student who 
had ever passed through his course had the utmost respect for him, and 
by now many were physicians. He had already made a reputation; that 
and his charm entered him into society as much as he desired. 
His closest friend was his preparatory school roommate Frederick 
Dennis, wealthy son of a railroad magnate and also a physician who had 
studied in Germany. At every opportunity Dennis had advanced Welch’s 
career, extolling his talents to editors of scientiﬁc journals, using his soci-
ety connections to help him in New York, occasionally even subsidizing 
him indirectly. Indeed, Dennis behaved more like a lover trying to win 
affection than a friend, even a close friend. 
But Dennis had always demanded a kind of fealty. Welch had hereto-
fore been willing to give it. Now Dennis demanded that Welch stay in 
New York. When Welch did not immediately agree, Dennis orchestrated 
an elaborate campaign to keep him there. He convinced Welch’s father to 
advise him to stay, he convinced Andrew Carnegie to donate $50,000 for 
a laboratory at Bellevue, and he convinced Bellevue itself to pledge 
another $45,000; that would match any laboratory in Baltimore. And not 
only Dennis urged Welch to stay. A prominent attorney whose son had 
studied under Welch warned him that going to Baltimore would be “the 
mistake of your life. It is not in a century that a man of your age has 
acquired the reputation which you have gained.” Even the president of 
the United States Trust Company sent a message that “however bright the 
prospect is in Baltimore it is darkness compared with the career” before 
him in New York. 
The pressure was not without effect. Dennis did get Welch to set con-
ditions that, if met, would cause him to stay. For Welch had his own 
doubts. Some related to his own ﬁtness. He had done almost no real sci-
ence in the years since returning from Germany. He had only talked for 
"
"55 
The Warriors 
years about how his need to make a living prevented him from conduct-
ing original research. 
The Hopkins expected more than talk. It had been open for eight 
years and, tiny as it was, had earned an international reputation. Welch 
confessed to his stepmother, “Such great things are expected of the fac-
ulty at the Johns Hopkins in the way of achievement and of reform of 
medical education in this country that I feel oppressed by the weight of 
responsibility. A reputation there will not be so cheaply earned as at 
Bellevue.” 
Yet precisely for that reason the Hopkins offered, he wrote, “undoubt-
edly the best opportunity in this country.” Declining would reveal him as 
a hypocrite and a coward. Meanwhile in New York, the conditions he had 
set were not met, although Dennis considered them to have been. 
Welch accepted the Hopkins offer. 
Dennis was furious. His friendship with Welch had been, at least on 
Dennis’s side, of great emotional depth and intensity. Now Dennis felt 
betrayed. 
Welch conﬁded to his stepmother, “I grieve that a life-long friendship 
should thus come to an end, but . . . [i]t looks almost as if Dr. Dennis 
thought he had a lien upon my whole future life. When he appealed to 
what he had done for me I told him that was a subject which I would in 
no way discuss with him.” 
Later Dennis sent Welch a letter formally breaking off their friend-
ship, a letter written with enough intensity that in the letter itself he asked 
Welch to burn it after reading. 
For Welch too the breaking off of the friendship was intense. He 
would not have another. Over much of the next half century, Welch’s 
closest collaborator would be his protégé Simon Flexner. Together they 
would achieve enormous things. And yet Flexner too was kept distant. 
Flexner himself wrote that after Welch’s estrangement from Dennis, 
“Never again would he allow any person, woman or colleague, close. . . .  
The bachelor scientist moved on a high plane of loneliness that may have 
held the secret of some of his power.” 
For the rest of his life Welch would remain alone. More than just 
alone, he would never dig in, never entrench himself, never root. 
He never married. Despite working with others in ways that so often 
bind people together as comrades, with the single possible exception of 
"
"56 
The Great Influenza 
the great and strange surgeon William Halsted—and that exception only 
a rumored possibility*—he had no known intimate relationship, sexual 
or otherwise, with either man or woman. Although he would live in Bal-
timore for half a century, he would never own a home there nor even 
have his own apartment; despite accumulating considerable wealth, he 
would live as a boarder, taking two rooms in the home of the same land-
lady, then moving with his landlady when she moved, and allowing his 
landlady’s daughter to inherit him as a boarder. He would take nearly 
every dinner in one of his gentlemen’s clubs, retreating to a world of men, 
cigars, and the conversations of an evening for the rest of his life. And he 
would, observed a young colleague, “deliberately break off relationships 
which seemed to threaten too strong an attachment.” 
But if he lived on the surface of ordinary life, his life was not ordinary. 
He was free, not just alone but free, free of entanglements of people, free 
of encumbrances of property, utterly free. 
He was free to do extraordinary things. 
At the Hopkins—it became simply “Hopkins” gradually, over several 
decades—Welch was expected to create an institution that would alter 
American medicine forever. When he accepted this charge in 1884, he 
was thirty-four years old. 
The Hopkins went about achieving its goal both directly and indi-
rectly. It served as home, however temporary, to much of the ﬁrst gener-
ation of men and women who were beginning the transformation of 
American medical science. And its example forced other institutions to 
follow its path—or disappear. 
In the process Welch gradually accumulated enormous personal 
power, a power built slowly, as a collector builds a collection. His ﬁrst step 
was to return to Germany. Already he had worked under Cohn, to whom 
Koch had brought his anthrax studies, Carl Ludwig, and Cohnheim, 
*Halsted had known Welch well in New York; both of them were trying to apply 
science to medicine. But Halsted began studying cocaine and became addicted. His 
life collapsed and he moved to Baltimore to be close to Welch. Once Halsted ended his 
addiction, Welch gave him a chance at the Hopkins, where he linked surgery to phys-
iological research and became the most inﬂuential surgeon in the country and 
arguably the world. Halsted did marry, but he was eccentric and erratic and became 
addicted to morphine. It was unclear if Welch knew of this addiction. 
"
"57 
The Warriors 
three of the leading scientists in the world, and had met the young Paul 
Ehrlich, his hands multicolored and dripping with dyes, whose insights 
combined with his knowledge of chemistry would allow him to make 
some of the greatest theoretical contributions to medicine of all. 
Now Welch visited nearly every prominent investigator in Germany. 
He had rank now, for he happily reported that the Hopkins “already has 
a German reputation while our New York medical schools are not even 
known by name.” He could entertain with stories, recite a Shakespeare 
sonnet, or bring to bear an enormous and growing breadth of scientiﬁc 
knowledge. Even those scientists so competitive as to be nearly paranoid 
opened their laboratories and their private speculations to him. His com-
bination of breadth and intelligence allowed him to see into the depths of 
their work as well as its broadest implications. 
He also learned bacteriology from two Koch protégés. One gave a 
“class” whose students were scientists from around the world, many of 
whom had already made names for themselves. In this group too he 
shined; his colleagues gave him the honor of offering the ﬁrst toast of 
appreciation to their teacher at a farewell banquet. And Welch learned 
the most from Koch himself, the greatest name in science, who accepted 
him into his famous course—given only once—for scientists who would 
teach others bacteriology. 
Then, back in Baltimore, years before its hospital or medical school 
actually opened, even without patients and without students, the Hop-
kins began to precipitate change. For although the Hopkins medical hos-
pital did not open until 1889, and the medical school until 1893, its 
laboratory opened almost immediately. That alone was enough. 
In just its ﬁrst year, twenty-six investigators not on the Hopkins fac-
ulty used the laboratories. Welch’s young assistant William Councilman— 
who later remade Harvard’s medical school in the Hopkins’s image—kept 
them supplied with organs by riding his tricycle to other hospitals, 
retrieving the organs, and carrying them back in buckets suspended from 
the handlebars. Many of these guests or graduate students were or 
became world-class investigators, including Walter Reed, James Carroll, 
and Jesse Lazear, three of the four doctors who defeated yellow fever. 
Within a few more years, ﬁfty physicians would be doing graduate work 
at the same time. 
And the Hopkins began assembling a faculty. Its institutional vision 
"
"58 
The Great Influenza 
combined with Welch himself allowed it to recruit an extraordinary one. 
Typical was Franklin Mall. 
Mall had gotten his medical degree from the University of Michigan in 
1883 at age twenty-one, gone to Germany and worked with Carl Ludwig, 
done some graduate work at the Hopkins, and had already made a mark. 
He expected—required—the highest conceivable standards, and not just 
from his students. Victor Vaughan, dean of the Michigan medical school 
and second only to Welch in his inﬂuence on American medical education, 
considered the school’s chemistry lab the best in America and compara-
ble to the best in the world. Mall dismissed it as “a small chemical lab” 
and called his Michigan education equal to that of a good high school. 
When Welch offered Mall a job, Mall was at the University of Chicago 
where he was planning the expenditure of $4 million, an enormous sum— 
John D. Rockefeller was the major donor to Chicago—to do what Welch 
was attempting, to build a great institution. Mall responded to Welch’s 
offer by proposing instead that Welch leave the Hopkins for Chicago at a 
signiﬁcant increase in salary. 
By contrast, the Hopkins was desperate for resources but Welch 
rejected Mall’s proposal and replied, “I can think of but one motive 
which might inﬂuence you to come here with us and that is the desire to 
live here and a belief in our ideals and our future. . . . They will not  
appeal to the great mass of the public, not even to the medical public, for 
a considerable time. What we shall consider success, the mass of doctors 
will not consider a success.” 
Mall considered the alternatives. At Chicago he had already, as he told 
Welch,“formulated the biological dept, got its outﬁt for $25,000 and have 
practically planned its building which will cost $200,000,” all of it funded, 
with more to come from Rockefeller. At the Hopkins there was a medical 
school faculty and, by now, a hospital, but no money yet with which to 
even open the school. (Its medical school ﬁnally opened only when a 
group of women, many of whom had also recently founded Bryn Mawr 
College, offered a $500,000 endowment provided that the medical school 
would accept women. The faculty and trustees reluctantly agreed.) But 
there was Welch. 
Mall wired him, “Shall cast my lot with Hopkins. . . . I consider you 
the greatest attraction. You make the opportunities.”

Yet it was not Welch’s laboratory investigations that attracted, that made 
opportunities. For, unknown to Gilman and Billings, who hired him, and 
even to Welch himself, he had a failing. 
Welch knew the methods of science, all right, could grasp immedi-
ately the signiﬁcance of an experimental result, could see and execute the 
design of further experiments to conﬁrm a ﬁnding or probe more deeply. 
But he had had those abilities during his six years in New York, when he 
did no science. He had told himself and others that the demands of mak-
ing a living had precluded research. 
Yet he had no family to support and others did magniﬁcent science 
under far greater burdens. No scientist had faced more adverse condi-
tions than George Sternberg, an autodidact whom Welch called “the real 
pioneer of modern bacteriologic work in this country . . . [who] mas-
tered the technique and literature by sheer persistence and native ability.” 
In 1878, as Welch met Billings in the same beer hall where legend 
had Faust meeting the Devil, Sternberg was an army medical ofﬁcer in 
combat with the Nez Perce Indians. From there he traveled by stagecoach 
for four hundred and ﬁfty miles—enduring day after day after day of 
the stink of sweat, of bone-shattering bumps that shot up the spine, of 
choking on the dust—only to reach a train, then by train for another 
twenty-ﬁve hundred miles of steaming discomfort, jostling elbows, and 
inedible food. He endured all this to attend a meeting of the American 
Public Health Association. While Welch was bemoaning his lack of facil-
ities in New York, Sternberg was building a laboratory largely at his own 
expense at a frontier army post. In 1881 he became the ﬁrst to isolate the 
pneumococcus, a few weeks before Pasteur and Koch. (None of the three 
recognized the bacteria’s full importance.) Sternberg also ﬁrst observed 
that white blood cells engulfed bacteria, a key to understanding the 
immune system. He failed to follow up on these observations, but many 
of his other achievements were remarkable, especially his pioneering 
work taking photographs through microscopes and his careful experi-
ments that determined both the temperature at which various kinds 
of bacteria died and the power of different disinfectants to kill them. 
That information allowed the creation of antiseptic conditions in both 
laboratory and public health work. Sternberg began that work too in a 
frontier post. 
"

The Great Influenza 
Meanwhile, in New York City Welch was swearing that if only he were 
free of economic worries his own research would ﬂower. 
In Baltimore his work did not ﬂower. For there, even with talented 
young investigators helping him, his failing began to demonstrate itself. 
His failing was this: in science as in the rest of his life, he lived upon 
the surface and did not root. His attention never settled upon one impor-
tant or profound question. 
The research he did was ﬁrst-rate. But it was only ﬁrst-rate—thorough, 
rounded, and even irrefutable, but not deep enough or provocative 
enough or profound enough to set himself or others down new paths, to 
show the world in a new way, to make sense out of great mysteries. His 
most important discoveries would be the bacteria now called Bacillus 
welchii, the cause of gas gangrene, and the ﬁnding that staphylococci live 
in layers of the skin, which meant that a surgeon had to disinfect not only 
the skin surface during an operation but layers beneath it. These were not 
unimportant ﬁndings, and, even in the absence of any single more bril-
liant success, if they had represented a tiny piece of a large body of compa-
rable work, they might have added up to enough to rank Welch as a giant. 
Instead they would be the only truly signiﬁcant results of his research. 
In the context of an entire lifetime, especially at a time when an entire 
universe lay naked to exploration, this work did not amount to much. 
The greatest challenge of science, its art, lies in asking an important 
question and framing it in a way that allows it to be broken into manage-
able pieces, into experiments that can be conducted that ultimately lead 
to answers. To do this requires a certain kind of genius, one that probes 
vertically and sees horizontally. 
Horizontal vision allows someone to assimilate and weave together 
seemingly unconnected bits of information. It allows an investigator to 
see what others do not see, and to make leaps of connectivity and cre-
ativity. Probing vertically, going deeper and deeper into something, cre-
ates new information. Sometimes what one ﬁnds will shine brilliantly 
enough to illuminate the whole world. 
At least one question connects the vertical and the horizontal. That 
question is “So what?” Like a word on a Scrabble board, this question can 
connect with and prompt movement in many directions. It can eliminate 
a piece of information as unimportant or, at least to the investigator ask-
ing the question, irrelevant. It can push an investigator to probe more 
"
"61 
The Warriors 
deeply to understand a piece of information. It can also force an investi-
gator to step back and see how to ﬁt a ﬁnding into a broader context. To 
see questions in these ways requires a wonder, a deep wonder focused by 
discipline, like a lens focusing the sun’s rays on a spot of paper until it 
bursts into ﬂame. It requires a kind of conjury. 
Einstein reportedly once said that his own major scientiﬁc talent was 
his ability to look at an enormous number of experiments and journal 
articles, select the very few that were both correct and important, ignore 
the rest, and build a theory on the right ones. In that assessment of his 
own abilities, Einstein was very likely overly modest. But part of his 
genius was an instinct for what mattered and the ability to pursue it ver-
tically and connect it horizontally. 
Welch had a vital and wide curiosity, but he did not have this deeper 
wonder. The large aroused him. But he could not see the large in the 
small. No question ever aroused a great passion in him, no question ever 
became a compulsion, no question ever forced him to pursue it until it 
was either exhausted or led him to new questions. Instead he examined a 
problem, then moved on. 
In his ﬁrst years at the Hopkins he would constantly refer to his work, 
refer to his need to return to the laboratory. Later he abandoned the pre-
tense and ceased even attempting to do research. Yet he never fully 
accepted his choice; to the end of his life he would sometimes express the 
wish that he had devoted himself to the laboratory. 
Nonetheless, despite this lack of scientiﬁc achievement, Welch did not 
live one of those lives that began with great promise and ended in bitter-
ness and disappointment. Despite his minimal production in the labora-
tory, people like Mall were drawn to him. As a prominent scientist said, 
“Everyone agrees that Welch himself was the great attraction at the 
Pathological. . . .  [H]is example, his intelligence, and his comprehensive 
knowledge formed the keystone of the arch of scientiﬁc medicine in 
America.” 
For William Welch’s real genius lay in two areas. 
First, he had not only knowledge but judgment. He had an extraordinary 
ability to hear someone describe his or her experiments, or read a paper, 
and immediately deﬁne the crucial points still obscure, the crucial series 
of experiments needed to clarify them. It was as if, although he could not 
"
"62 
The Great Influenza 
himself conjure, he knew the techniques of conjuring and could teach 
others conjury. 
He had an equally extraordinary ability to judge people, to identify 
those with the promise to do what he had not done. He largely chose the 
medical school faculty, and he chose brilliantly. All were young when 
appointed. Welch was thirty-four; William Osler, a Canadian and arguably 
the most famous clinical physician of the modern era, forty; William 
Halsted, a surgeon who changed the way surgeons thought, thirty-seven; 
Howard Kelly, a gynecologist and pioneer in radiation therapy, thirty-
one; J. J. Abel, a chemist and pharmacologist who would discover adren-
aline and help revolutionize pharmacopoeia, thirty-six; W. H. Howell, a 
physiologist, thirty-three; and Mall, thirty-one. (Howell, Abel, and Mall 
had been graduate students at the Hopkins.) 
Second, Welch inspired. He inspired unconsciously, simply by being 
himself. In the early days of the school, Welch was heavy but not yet fat, 
short, with bright blue eyes that ﬂashed above a dark beard called an 
“imperial”—a mustache and pointed goatee. He dressed conservatively 
but well in dark clothes and often carried a derby hat in his hand. Despite 
his bulk, his hands and feet were conspicuously small and made him 
appear almost delicate. But his most singular quality was not physical. He 
seemed so centered and comfortable with himself that he gave comfort to 
those around him. He exuded conﬁdence without arrogance, smugness, 
or pomposity. In his disputes—and he had many with those outsiders 
who resisted changes—he never raised his voice, never seemed to feel, 
according to a man who watched him for decades, “the exuberant joy of 
putting an opponent down.” 
Everything about him was positive. His intelligence and the depth 
and breadth of his knowledge stimulated his teaching as well. He walked 
into the classroom without notes or preparation, often not knowing what 
subject he was to lecture on, and in an instant began discoursing lucidly 
and logically in ways that provoked thought and excitement. He was 
paternal without being paternalistic. Physicians sent him pathology sam-
ples for analysis and paid a hefty fee. His assistants did the work; he wrote 
up the results and gave them the money. He loved to eat and hosted lav-
ish dinners at his club, the Maryland Club, often inviting junior col-
leagues or graduate students; one of them called these dinners among his 
“rosiest memories” because of Welch’s conversation, his ability to make 
"
"63 
The Warriors 
students feel “the richness of the world”—the world of art and literature 
as well as science. 
The total effect, said Simon Flexner, “made for an atmosphere of 
achievement . . .  The desire to be like Welch, the desire to win his 
approval, these were the principal incentives of the eager young men who 
crowded his lab.” 
Finally, a certain mystery clung to Welch. Although this was not part 
of his genius it explained part of his impact. For all his cordiality he 
remained distant. The cordiality itself was a barrier others could not pen-
etrate. He paid little, and decreasing, attention to students until they did 
something signiﬁcant enough to get his attention. He seemed casual, 
even sloppy. He would get so animated in conversation that his cigar ash 
would routinely drop onto his coat, where it would lie unnoticed. He was 
never on time. His desk would be piled with months of unanswered cor-
respondence. Younger colleagues gave him a nickname, a nickname that 
spread from the Hopkins to younger scientists everywhere. They called 
him, never to his face, “Popsy.” 
It was a comfortable, paternal, and warm nickname. But if he gave 
comfort, he took comfort from no one. Although he helped all whom he 
deemed worthy, although he surrounded himself with people, he neither 
encouraged nor allowed anyone to conﬁde personal troubles to him. And 
he conﬁded in no one. Mall once wrote his sister that he longed for a real 
friendship with Welch, not just an acquaintanceship. Even Mall would 
not get it. Welch took vacations alone in Atlantic City, where he enjoyed 
its tackiness. 
The students had a chant: “Nobody knows where Popsy eats / Nobody 
knows where Popsy sleeps / Nobody knows whom Popsy keeps / But 
Popsy.” 
The Hopkins medical school sat on the city’s outskirts atop a hill, miles 
from the main campus of the university and downtown. The main build-
ing, the Pathological Laboratory, was ugly and squat, two stories of stone, 
with six tall windows on each ﬂoor, and square chimneys towering above 
the building itself. Inside, an amphitheater for autopsies hollowed out the 
building, and students on the top ﬂoor could peer down over railings; a 
long narrow room lined each ﬂoor, a pathology laboratory on the ﬁrst 
ﬂoor, a bacteriology laboratory on the second. 
"
"64 
The Great Influenza 
Even without the school, once the hospital opened in 1889, with six-
teen buildings on fourteen acres, a small community began to develop. 
People breakfasted together and lunched together every day, and often 
met in the evening. Every Monday night a slightly more formal group 
of thirty to forty people gathered, including faculty, students who 
already had an M.D. or Ph.D., and clinicians. They would discuss current 
research or cases, and comments routinely generated new questions. 
Senior faculty sometimes dined in evening clothes at the “high table” in a 
bay window overlooking the grounds. The younger men played poker 
together, entertained each other, and went to the “Church” together— 
Hanselmann’s restaurant and bar, at Wolfe and Monument, where they 
drank beer. A Harvard professor compared the Hopkins to a monastery. 
Harvey Cushing said, “In the history of medicine there was never any-
thing quite like it.” And they did have a mission. 
Elias Canetti, a Nobel laureate in literature, observed in his book 
Crowds and Power that large movements were often generated by what he 
called “crowd crystals, . . .  the small, rigid groups of men, strictly delim-
ited and of great constancy, which serve to precipitate crowds. Their 
structure is such that they can be comprehended and taken in at a glance. 
Their unity is more important than their size. Their role must be famil-
iar; people must know what they are there for. . . .  The crowd crystal is 
constant. . . .  Its members are trained in both action and faith. . . . The  
clarity, isolation, and constancy of the crystal form an uncanny contrast 
with the excited ﬂux of the surrounding crowd.” 
In the same way that precipitates fall out of solution and coalesce 
around a crystal, individuals with extraordinary abilities and a shared vision 
had now coalesced about Welch at the Hopkins. Together, with a handful 
of others around the country, they intended to precipitate a revolution. 
"
"C H A P T E R  FO U R  
A
merican medical education needed a revolution. When the 
Hopkins medical school did at last open in 1893, most American 
medical schools had still not established any afﬁliation with either a teach-
ing hospital or a university, most faculty salaries were still paid by student 
fees, and students still often graduated without ever touching a patient. Nor 
did Welch exaggerate when he said that, other than the Hopkins, no Amer-
ican “medical school requires for admission knowledge approaching that 
necessary for entrance into the freshman class of a respectable college. . . .  
[S]ome require no evidence of preliminary education whatever.” 
By contrast, the Hopkins itself, not student fees, paid faculty salaries, 
and it required medical students to have not only a college degree but ﬂu-
ency in French and German and a background of science courses. 
Indeed, these requirements were so rigorous that Welch and Osler wor-
ried that the Hopkins would attract no students. 
But students did come. They came ﬂocking. Motivated and self-
selected, they ﬂocked to a school where students did not simply listen to 
lectures and take notes. They trooped through hospital rooms and exam-
ined patients, made diagnoses, heard the crepitant rales of a diseased 
lung, felt the alien and inhuman marble texture of a tumor. They per-
formed autopsies, conducted laboratory experiments, and they explored: 
they explored organs with scalpels, nerves and muscles with electric cur-
rents, the invisible with microscopes. 
"
"66 
The Great Influenza 
Those at the Hopkins were hardly alone in seeking reform. The need 
had been recognized for decades. Leaders at a few other medical 
schools—especially Vaughan at Michigan, William Pepper Jr. at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, William Councilman (Welch’s assistant until 
1892) at Harvard, others at Northwestern, at New York’s College of Physi-
cians and Surgeons, at Tulane—were advancing the same values that 
Welch and the Hopkins were, and they were doing so with equal urgency. 
The American Medical Association had pushed reform since its incep-
tion, and individual physicians sought better training as well; the thou-
sands who studied in Europe proved that. 
But relatively little change had occurred in the bulk of medical 
schools, and even at Harvard, Penn, and elsewhere, change had often 
come only after violent inﬁghting, with continual rear-guard actions 
fought by reluctant faculty. William Pepper had made Penn good enough 
that the Hopkins raided its faculty, yet after sixteen years of ﬁghting he 
spoke not of achievement but of “long and painful controversy.” 
Even where change had occurred, a gap between the Hopkins and 
elsewhere still remained. Harvey Cushing trained at Harvard and came to 
Baltimore as Halsted’s assistant. Nothing in Boston had prepared him for 
the difference. He found the Hopkins “strange. . . .  The talk was of pathol-
ogy and bacteriology of which I knew so little that much of my time the 
ﬁrst few months was passed alone at night in the room devoted to surgi-
cal pathology looking at specimens with a German textbook at hand.” 
The Hopkins did not limit its inﬂuence to medicine. Half a century after 
it opened, of 1,000 men starred in the 1926 edition of American Men of Sci-
ence, 243 had Hopkins degrees; second was Harvard with 190. Even Har-
vard’s Charles Eliot conceded that the Harvard Graduate School “started 
feebly” and “did not thrive, until the example of Johns Hopkins. . . . And  
what was true of Harvard was true of every other university in the land.” 
But in medicine the Hopkins made its chief mark. As early as 1900 
Welch noted that at the Harvard-run Boston City Hospital “they have 
only Hopkins men there, and want no others.” By 1913 a European 
acknowledged that research in the United States in his ﬁeld rivaled that 
done in any European country and gave credit “to one man—Franklin P. 
Mall at the Johns Hopkins University.” Of the ﬁrst four American Nobel 
laureates in physiology or medicine, the Hopkins had trained three, while 
the fourth had received his highest degree in Europe. 
"
"67 
The Warriors 
In patient care its impact was similar. As with all medical schools, 
most of its graduates became practicing physicians. And within thirty-
ﬁve years after opening, more than 10 percent of all Hopkins graduates 
had become full professors, with many younger graduates on track to 
do so. Many of these men transformed entire medical schools at other 
universities—people like Councilman and Cushing at Harvard, William 
MacCallum at Columbia, Eugene Opie at Washington University, Milton 
Winternitz at Yale, George Whipple (a Nobel laureate) at Rochester. 
Howard Kelly, for all his strangeness—a fundamentalist who preached 
to prostitutes on street corners of whom one student said, “The only inter-
est he manifested in my classmates was whether they were saved”— 
revolutionized gynecology and pioneered radiation therapy. And no 
individual had more impact on patient care than William Halsted, who 
introduced rubber gloves into surgery, who insisted upon preparation 
and thought prior to every step. He took such care that William Mayo 
once joked that his patients were healed by the time he ﬁnished, but the 
Mayo brothers also stated that they owed him a tremendous debt. So did 
all of American surgery: of seventy-two surgeons who served as residents 
or assistant residents under him, ﬁfty-three became professors. 
In the meantime, Henry James described the Hopkins as a place 
where, despite “the immensities of pain” one thought of “ﬁne poetry . . .  
and the high beauty of applied science. . . . Grim human alignments 
became, in their cool vistas, delicate symphonies in white. . . . Doctors  
ruled, for me, so gently, the whole still concert.” 
Behind this still concert lay Welch, the impresario. By the ﬁrst decade of 
the twentieth century, Welch had become the glue that cemented together 
the entire American medical establishment. His own person became a 
central clearinghouse of scientiﬁc medicine. Indeed, he became the cen-
tral clearinghouse. As founding editor of the Journal of Experimental Med-
icine, the ﬁrst and most important American research journal, he read 
submissions that made him familiar with every promising new idea and 
young investigator in the country. 
He became a national ﬁgure, ﬁrst within the profession, then within 
science, then in the larger world, serving as president or chairman of 
nineteen different major scientiﬁc organizations, including the American 
Medical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of 
"
"68 
The Great Influenza 
Science, and the National Academy of Sciences. Stanford president Ray 
Wilbur neither ﬂattered nor overstated when in 1911 he wrote him, “Not 
to turn to you for information in regard to the best men to ﬁll vacancies 
in our medical school would be to violate all the best precedents of 
American medical education.” Welch had, said one colleague, “the power 
to transform men’s lives almost by the ﬂick of a wrist.” 
But his use of power in placing people in positions—or for that mat-
ter using it for such things as defeating antivivisection legislation, which 
would have prevented using animals as experimental models and thus 
crippled medical research—was trivial in its impact compared to his 
application of power to two other areas. 
One area involved completing the reform of all medical education. 
The example of the Hopkins had forced more and faster reforms at the 
best schools. But too many medical schools remained almost entirely 
unaffected by the Hopkins example. Those schools would learn a harsh 
lesson, and soon. 
Welch’s second interest involved starting and directing the ﬂow of 
tens of millions of dollars into laboratory research. 
In Europe governments, universities, and wealthy donors helped support 
medical research. In the United States, no government, institution, or 
philanthropist even began to approach a similar level of support. As the 
Hopkins medical school was opening, American theological schools 
enjoyed endowments of $18 million, while medical school endowments 
totaled $500,000. The difference in ﬁnancial support as well as educa-
tional systems largely explained why Europeans had achieved the bulk of 
medical advances. 
Those advances had been extraordinary, for medicine in the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries was experiencing arguably its most 
golden age—including anytime since. The germ theory had opened the 
door to that progress. Finally investigators began using that door. 
In 1880 Pasteur—who observed,“Chance favors the prepared mind”— 
was trying to prove he had isolated the cause of chicken cholera. He 
inoculated healthy chickens with the bacteria. They died. Then chance 
intervened. He had put aside a virulent culture for several days, then used 
it to inoculate more chickens. They lived. More signiﬁcantly, those same 
"
"69 
The Warriors 
chickens survived when exposed to other virulent cultures. Crediting 
Jenner for the idea, he tried to weaken, or “attenuate,” his word, cultures 
and use them to immunize birds against lethal bacteria. He succeeded. 
He began applying these techniques to other infections. With anthrax 
he was not the ﬁrst to experiment with weakened cultures, but his work 
was both deﬁnitive and very public. While a gallery of newspapermen 
and ofﬁcials watched, he inoculated cattle, then exposed them to anthrax; 
the inoculuated ones lived, while the controls died. Three years later 3.3 
million sheep and 438,000 cattle were vaccinated against anthrax in 
France. He also saved the life of a boy bitten by a rabid dog by giving him 
gradually stronger injections of ﬂuid containing the pathogen. The next 
year, 1886, an international fund-raising drive created the Pasteur Insti-
tute. Almost immediately the German goverment funded research insti-
tutes for Koch and a few other outstanding investigators, and research 
institutes were founded in Russia, Japan, and Britain. 
Meanwhile, public health measures were containing cholera and 
typhoid, and in Germany, Richard Pfeiffer, Koch’s greatest disciple, and 
Wilhelm Kolle immunized two human volunteers with heat-killed ty-
phoid bacilli. In Britain Sir Almroth Wright advanced upon this work 
and developed a vaccine against typhoid. 
All these advances prevented infectious disease. But no physician 
could yet cure a patient who was dying of one. That was about to change. 
One of the deadliest of childhood diseases was diphtheria. Usually it 
killed by choking its victims to death—by generating a membrane that 
closed the breathing passages. In Spain the disease was called el garrotillo, 
“the strangler.” 
In 1884, German scientist Friedrich Loefﬂer isolated the diphtheria 
bacillus from throats of patients, grew it on a special medium (laborato-
ries today still use “Loefﬂer’s serum slope” to grow the bacteria from sus-
pected cases), and began careful experiments in animals that took several 
years. His work suggested that the bacteria themselves did not kill; the 
danger came from a toxin, a poison, that the bacteria excreted. 
In 1889 Pasteur’s protégés Émile Roux and Alexandre Yersin grew 
broth thick with diphtheria bacteria and used compressed air to force the 
broth through a ﬁlter of unglazed porcelain. (The ﬁlter was designed by 
Charles Chamberland, a physicist working with Pasteur; though only a 
"
"70 
The Great Influenza 
tool, the ﬁlter itself would prove to be immensely important.) No bacte-
ria or solids could pass through the porcelain. Only liquid could. They 
then sterilized this liquid. It still killed. That proved that a soluble toxin 
did the killing. 
Meanwhile, an American physiologist named Henry Sewall at the 
University of Michigan was studying snake venom, which chemically 
resembles many bacterial toxins. In 1887 he immunized pigeons against 
rattlesnake poison. 
If pigeons could be immunized, humans likely could be too. As 
they had with cholera, French and German scientists raced each other, 
building upon Sewall’s and each other’s advances, studying both diph-
theria and tetanus. In December 1890, Koch protégés Emil Behring, who 
would later win the Nobel Prize, and Shibasaburo Kitasato showed that 
serum—the ﬂuid left after all solids are removed from blood—drawn 
from one animal made immune to tetanus could be injected into a dif-
ferent animal and protect it from disease. 
The paper shook the scientiﬁc world. Work on diphtheria at a level 
of intensity heretofore unknown proceeded in laboratories. Over the 
Christmas holiday in 1891 in Berlin, the ﬁrst attempt to cure a person of 
diphtheria was made. It succeeded. 
Scientists had discovered a way not simply to prevent a disease. They 
had found a way to cure disease. It was the ﬁrst cure. 
Over the next few years work continued. In 1894, Émile Roux of the 
Pasteur Institute read his paper summarizing experiments with diphthe-
ria antitoxin before the International Congress on Hygiene in Budapest. 
Many of the greatest scientists in the world sat in the audience. 
As Roux ﬁnished, these men, each renowned in his own right, began to 
clap, then stood on their seats, their hands making thunderous sounds, 
their voices shouting applause in half a dozen languages, their hats 
thrown to the ceiling. Welch then reported American experiences con-
ﬁrming the work of both the French and Germans. And each delegate 
returned to his home with a bottle of this marvelous curative agent in his 
possession. 
In the keynote speech at the next meeting of the Association of American 
Physicians, an association created to foster scientiﬁc medicine, Welch 
"
"71

said, “The discovery of the healing serum is entirely the result of labora-
tory work. In no sense was the discovery an accidental one. Every step 
leading to it can be traced, and every step was taken with a deﬁnite pur-
pose and to solve a deﬁnite problem. These studies and resulting discov-
eries mark an epoch in the history of medicine.” 
His comment was a declaration not of war but of victory. Scientiﬁc 
medicine had developed technologies that could both prevent and cure dis-
eases that had previously killed in huge numbers, and killed gruesomely. 
And if French and German scientists had found the antitoxin, Amer-
icans William Park, chief of the laboratory division of the New York City 
Health Department, and Anna Williams, his deputy and perhaps the 
leading female bacteriologist in this country—possibly anywhere— 
transformed it into something that every doctor in the developed world 
had easy access to. They were an odd couple: he with an original and creative 
mind but staid, even stolid, extremely precise and well organized; she, 
wild, risk taking, intensely curious, a woman who took new inventions 
apart to see how they worked. They complemented each other perfectly. 
In 1894 they discovered a way to make a toxin ﬁve hundred times as 
potent as that used by Europeans. This lethality made a far more efﬁcient 
stimulator of antitoxin and slashed the cost to one-tenth what it had 
been. Park then broke the production process into tasks that ordinary 
workers, not scientists, could perform and turned part of the laboratory 
into a virtual factory. It soon became by far the cheapest, most efﬁcient, 
and reliable producer of the antitoxin in the world. Diphtheria-antitoxin 
production today is still based on their methods. 
The lab distributed it free in New York and sold it elsewhere. Park 
used the money to subsidize basic research and make the city laboratories 
into arguably the best medical research institution in the country at the 
time. Its annual reports soon contained, according to one historian of 
medicine, “a body of research of which any Institute in the world would 
be proud.” 
And the antitoxin suddenly became available around the world. 
Diphtheria fatality rates quickly fell by almost two-thirds, and country 
doctors began to perform miracles. It was only the ﬁrst miracle of what 
promised to be many.

As the use of this antitoxin was becoming widespread, Frederick Gates, 
an intellectually curious Baptist minister who had a gift for seeing oppor-
tunities to exploit and was an assistant to John D. Rockefeller, picked up 
a medical textbook written by William Osler called The Principles and 
Practice of Medicine, a textbook that would go through many editions 
and ﬁnd a readership among both physicians and informed laymen. In it 
Osler traced the evolution of medical ideas, explored controversies, and, 
most signiﬁcantly, admitted uncertainty and ignorance. 
Gates had started working for Rockefeller as a philanthropic adviser, 
but nothing limited him to eleemosynary concerns. He organized several 
Rockefeller business ventures, pulling, for example, a $50 million proﬁt 
out of the Mesabi iron range in Minnesota. Rockefeller himself used a 
homeopathic physician, and Gates had also read The New Testament of 
Homeopathic Medicine, written by Samuel Hahnemann, founder of the 
movement. Gates decided that Hahnemann “must have been, to speak 
charitably, little less than lunatic.” 
Osler’s book impressed Gates in very different ways for it presented a 
paradox. First, it showed that medical science had immense promise. But 
it also showed that that promise was far from being realized. “It became 
clear to me that medicine could hardly hope to become a science,” Gates 
explained, “until . . . qualiﬁed men could give themselves to uninter-
rupted study and investigation, on ample salary, entirely independent of 
practice. . . . Here  was an opportunity, to me the greatest, which the 
world could afford, for Mr. Rockefeller to become a pioneer.” 
Meanwhile, John D. Rockefeller Jr. talked about the idea of funding 
medical research with two prominent physicians, L. Emmett Holt and 
Christian Herter, both former students of Welch. Both eagerly endorsed 
the idea. 
On January 2, 1901, Rockefeller Sr.’s grandchild John Rockefeller 
McCormick, also the grandchild of Cyrus McCormick, died of scarlet 
fever in Chicago. 
Later that year the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was 
incorporated. It would change everything. 
Welch declined the offer to head the new institute but he assumed all the 
duties of launching it, chairing both the institute board itself and its 
board of scientiﬁc directors. That scientiﬁc board included Welch’s old 
"
"73 
The Warriors 
friend T. Mitchell Prudden, Holt, Herter, two other prominent scientists 
who had been students of Welch, and Harvard’s Theobald Smith. Smith, 
one of the leading bacteriologists in the world, had been Welch’s ﬁrst 
choice for director but had declined because he had done most of his 
research on animal diseases—for example, developing a vaccine to pre-
vent hog cholera—and thought it would be more politic to have a direc-
tor who had investigated human disease. 
So Welch offered the position to Simon Flexner, who had left the 
Hopkins to take a highly prestigious professorship at the University of 
Pennsylvania’s medical school. (Flexner had rejected an offer of an $8,000 
salary from Cornell to take the position at Penn at $5,000.) But his appoint-
ment had been contentious, and at the meeting where he was chosen one 
faculty member said that accepting the Jew as a professor did not involve 
accepting him as a man. Daily he fought with other faculty over both per-
sonal and substantive issues. 
Flexner accepted Welch’s offer, and a raise. But the launching of the 
institute remained ﬁrmly under Welch’s control. In this, Flexner said, 
Welch “accepted no assistance, not even clerical. Every detail was attended 
to with his own hand, every letter handwritten.” 
The European research institutes were either dedicated to infectious 
disease or designed to allow freedom to individuals such as Pasteur, Koch, 
and Ehrlich. The Rockefeller Institute saw medicine itself as its ﬁeld; from 
its earliest existence, scientists there studied infectious disease, but they 
also laid the groundwork in surgery for organ transplants, established 
links between viruses and cancer, and developed a method to store blood. 
At ﬁrst the institute gave modest grants to scientists elsewhere, but in 
1903 it opened its own laboratory, in 1910 its own hospital. And Flexner 
began to come into his own. 
There was a roughness about Simon Flexner, something left over from 
the streets, from his growing up the black sheep in an immigrant Jewish 
family in Louisville, Kentucky. Older and younger brothers were brilliant 
students, but he quit school in the sixth grade. Sullen and ﬂirting with 
delinquency, he was ﬁred even by an uncle from a menial job in a pho-
tography studio. Next he worked for a dry-goods dealer who defrauded 
people and ﬂed the city. A druggist ﬁred him. His father gave him a tour 
of the city jail to try to frighten him into obedience, then arranged a 
"
"74 
The Great Influenza 
plumbing apprenticeship, but the plumber balked when Simon’s old 
principal warned him “not to have anything to do with Simon Flexner.” 
At the age of nineteen Flexner got another job with a druggist, wash-
ing bottles. The shop had a microscope and the druggist forbade him to 
touch it. He ignored the order. Flexner hated any kind of tedium, and 
taking orders. What the microscope showed him was not at all tedious. 
Abruptly his mind engaged. He was fascinated. He began making sud-
den impossible leaps. In a single year he ﬁnished a two-year program at 
the Louisville College of Pharmacy and won the gold medal for best stu-
dent. He began working for his older brother Jacob, another druggist 
who also had a microscope; now Simon did not have sneak to use it. 
Simultaneously he went to a medical school—at night. Flexner later 
recalled, “I never made a physical examination. I never heard a heart or 
lung sound.” 
But he did get an M.D. His younger brother Abraham had graduated 
from the Hopkins, and Simon sent some of his microscopic observations 
to Welch. Soon Simon was studying at the Hopkins himself. 
Welch took to him though they were opposites. Flexner was small and 
wiry, almost wizened, and no one ever called him charming. He had an 
edgy insecurity and said, “I have never been educated in any branch of 
learning. There are great gaps in my knowledge.” To ﬁll the gaps, he read. 
“He read,” his brother Abraham said, “as he ate.” He devoured books, read 
everything, read omnivorously, from English literature to Huxley and 
Darwin. He felt he had to learn. His insecurities never fully left him. He 
talked of “sleepless nights and days of acute fear . . . a  maddening ner-
vousness which prevented me from having a quiet moment.” 
Yet others recognized in him extraordinary possibilities. Welch arranged 
a fellowship for him in Germany, and four years later he became profes-
sor of pathology at the Hopkins. Often he went into the ﬁeld: to a mining 
town to study meningitis, to the Philippines to study dysentery, to Hong 
Kong to study plague. Nobel laureate Peyton Rous later called Flexner’s 
scientiﬁc papers “a museum in print, only they stir with life; for he exper-
imented as well as described.” 
He never lost his street toughness but his sharp hard edges did 
become rounded. He married a woman who was herself extraordinary 
enough to captivate Bertrand Russell (sixty letters from him were in her 
"
"75 
The Warriors 
papers) and whose sister was a founder of Bryn Mawr. The famed jurist 
Learned Hand became a close friend. And he left his mark on the Rocke-
feller Institute. 
Emerson said that an institution is the lengthened shadow of one 
man, and the institute did reﬂect Simon Flexner. Raymond Fosdick, later 
president of the Rockefeller Foundation, talked of the “steely precision of 
his reason. His mind was like a searchlight that could be turned at will on 
any question that came before him.” A Rockefeller researcher said he had 
“a logic far beyond that of most men, ﬁnal as a knife.” 
But in place of the comfort and monastic purpose and intimacy that 
Welch gave the Hopkins, Flexner made Rockefeller sharp, edgy, cold. 
Once, when the usefulness ended of horses that had been immunized 
against a disease, then bled over and over to produce antiserum, he never 
considered turning them out to pasture; he considered only either selling 
them for slaughter “to manufacturers or they can be bled further, with 
the idea of sacriﬁcing them”—bleeding them to death for a ﬁnal harvest 
of serum. He could dismiss a person as easily, ridding the institute of 
what he termed “unoriginal” men as soon as he made that determination. 
The room most feared in the institute was Flexner’s ofﬁce. He could be 
brutal there, and several prominent scientists were afraid of him. Even at 
Flexner’s memorial service, a Nobel laureate said, “Individuals were as 
nothing to Dr. Flexner compared with the welfare of the institute.” 
He sought attention for the institute from the press and credit from 
the scientiﬁc community. His own work created controversy. Shortly 
after the Rockefeller Institute was established, a meningitis epidemic 
struck the eastern United States. Desperate measures were used to ﬁght 
the infection. Diphtheria antitoxin was tried, and some physicians even 
tried the ancient practice of bleeding patients. At the Hopkins, Cushing 
tried draining pus-ﬁlled ﬂuid from the spinal canal. 
At the Rockefeller Institute, the meningitis epidemic seemed a partic-
ular challenge. Rockefeller and Gates wanted results. Flexner wanted to 
produce them. 
Ten years earlier William Park, who had perfected diphtheria antitoxin, 
had developed a serum against meningococci. In every laboratory test 
his serum had worked. But it had had no effect on people. Now two Ger-
mans developed a similar serum, but they injected it directly into the 
"
"76 
The Great Influenza 
spinal column instead of into veins or muscle. Normally the mortality 
rate from the disease was 80 percent. In 102 patients they cut the mortal-
ity to 67 percent, suggestive but not a statistically signiﬁcant improve-
ment. 
Still, Flexner’s instincts told him it meant something. He repeated the 
German experiments. His patients died at a 75 percent rate. Instead of 
discarding the approach, however, he persisted; he began a long series of 
experiments, both in the laboratory, to improve the serum’s potency, and 
physiologically, searching for the best way to administer it to monkeys. 
After three years of work, he settled upon the method: ﬁrst, to insert a 
needle intrathecally—under a thin membrane lining the spinal cord— 
and withdraw 50 ccs of spinal ﬂuid, and then to inject 30 ccs of serum. 
(Unless ﬂuid was withdrawn ﬁrst, the injection could increase pressure 
and cause paralysis.) It worked. In 712 people the mortality rate fell to 
31.4 percent. 
Physicians from Boston, San Francisco, Nashville—all conﬁrmed the 
work, with one noting, “Remarkable results were obtained in the use of 
this serum by the country practitioners.” 
Not all accepted Flexner’s role. Later, in a bacteriology textbook, Park 
implied that Flexner had contributed little to the development of the 
serum. Flexner responded with an angry visit to Park’s lab; a shouting 
matching ensued. There would be further disputes between the two, pub-
lic enough that newspapers reported on one. 
Ultimately Flexner cut the death rate for patients infected by the 
meningococcus, the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, to 18 
percent. According to a recent New England Journal of Medicine study, 
today with antibiotics patients at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of 
the best hospitals in the world, suffering from bacterial meningitis have a 
mortality rate of 25 percent. 
He and the institute received massive amounts of publicity. He liked 
it and wanted more. So did Gates and Rockefeller. In the ﬁrst decade 
of the institute especially, whenever someone there seemed on the edge 
of something exciting, Flexner hovered about. His constant attention 
seemed to demand results, and he routinely urged investigators to pub-
lish, writing, for example, “In view of the rapidity with which publica-
tions are appearing from Belgium and France, I advise the publication of 
your present results. Please see me about this promptly.” 
"
"77 
The Warriors 
The pressure did not all come from Flexner. It simply ﬂowed down 
through him. At a 1914 dinner Gates declared, “Who has not felt the 
throbbing desire to be useful to the whole wide world? The discoveries of 
this institute have already reached the depths of Africa with their healing 
ministrations. . . . You  announce a discovery here. Before night your dis-
covery will be ﬂashed around the world. In 30 days it will be in every 
medical college on earth.” 
The result was a publicity machine. Highly respected investigators 
mocked the institute for, said one who himself spent time there, “frequent 
ballyhoo of unimportant stuff as the work of genius” because of “adminis-
trators and directors impelled by the desire for institutional advertising.” 
Yet Flexner also had a large vision. In his own work, he had what 
Welch lacked: the ability to ask a large question and frame it in ways that 
made answering it achievable. And when he judged an investigator orig-
inal, an asset to the institute, he gave his full support. He did so with 
Nobel laureates Alexis Carrel and Karl Landsteiner, both of whose work 
was recognized early, but he also gave freedom and support to young 
investigators who had not yet made their mark. Peyton Rous, whose 
undergraduate and medical degrees both came from the Hopkins, would 
win the Nobel Prize for his discovery that a virus could cause cancer. He 
made that ﬁnding in 1911. The prize did not come until 1966. Initially 
the scientiﬁc community mocked him; it took that long for his work ﬁrst 
to be conﬁrmed, then appreciated. Yet Flexner always stood by him. 
Thomas Rivers, a Hopkins-trained scientist at Rockefeller who deﬁned 
the difference between viruses and bacteria, recalled, “I am not saying 
Flexner wasn’t tough or couldn’t be mean—he could, believe me—but he 
also was tender with people.” 
Even in a formal report to the board of scientiﬁc directors, thinking of 
Rous perhaps, or perhaps Paul Lewis, an extraordinarily promising 
young scientist working directly with Flexner, Flexner said, “The ablest 
men are often the most difﬁdent and self-deprecatory. They require in 
many cases to be reassured and made to believe in themselves.” When 
another scientist Flexner had faith in wanted to switch ﬁelds, Flexner told 
him, “It will take two years for you to ﬁnd your way. I won’t expect any-
thing from you until after that.” 
And ﬁnally Flexner believed in openness. He welcomed disagreement, 
expected friction and interaction, wanted the institute to become a living 
"
"78 
The Great Influenza 
thing. The lunchroom was as important to Flexner as the laboratory. 
There colleagues working in different areas exchanged ideas. “Rous was a 
brilliant conversationalist, Jacques Loeb, Carrel,” recalled Michael Heidel-
berger, then a junior investigator. Although Rous and Carrel won the 
Nobel Prize, Loeb may have been the most provocative. “These were 
really remarkable sessions sometimes. They were a great inspiration.” 
Each Friday especially mattered; investigators routinely presented 
their most recent work in a casual setting, and colleagues made com-
ments, suggested experiments, added different contexts. It was a place of 
excitement, of near holiness, even though some men—Karl Landsteiner, 
for instance, another Nobel laureate—almost never made presentations. 
Flexner actively sought out individualists who did not ﬁt in elsewhere, 
whether they be loners or prima donnas. The mix was what mattered. 
Flexner, Rous said, made the institute “an organism, not an establish-
ment.” 
And Flexner’s impact, like Welch’s, was extending far beyond any-
thing he did personally in the laboratory, or for that matter, in the Rock-
efeller Institute itself. 
Even before the institute had exerted wide inﬂuence, American medical 
science was attaining world class. In 1908 the International Congress on 
Tuberculosis was held in Washington. Robert Koch came from Germany, 
great and imperious, prepared to pass judgment and issue decrees. 
At a meeting of the section on pathology and bacteriology, which 
Welch headed, Park read a paper stating that “it is now absolutely estab-
lished that quite a number of children have contracted fatal generalized 
tuberculosis from bacilli” in cow’s milk. Koch insisted Park was wrong, 
that no evidence supported the idea that cattle gave tuberculosis to man. 
Theobald Smith then rose and supported Park. Arguments broke out all 
over the room. But the congress as a whole was convinced; a few days 
later, it passed a resolution calling for preventive measures against the 
spread of tuberculosis from cattle to man. Koch snapped, “Gentlemen, 
you may pass your resolutions, but posterity will decide!” 
One delegate noted, “Dr. Koch isolated the tubercle bacillus; today, 
science isolated Dr. Koch.” 
Science is not democratic. Votes do not matter. Yet this vote marked 
"

the coming of age of American medicine. It was by no means due solely 
to the Hopkins. Neither Park nor Smith had trained or taught there. But 
the Hopkins and the Rockefeller Institute were about to ﬁt two more 
pieces into place that would give American medicine a true claim to sci-
entiﬁc leadership. 
"

he men who created the Rockefeller Institute always intended 
to have a small afﬁliated hospital built to investigate disease. No 
patient would pay for treatment and only those suffering from diseases 
being studied would be admitted. No other research institute in the 
world had such a facility. That much William Welch, Simon Flexner, 
Frederick Gates, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. did intend. But they did not 
plan to have what Rufus Cole, the hospital’s ﬁrst director, all but forced 
upon them. 
Tall, mustached, and elegant, with an ancestor who arrived at Ply-
mouth, Massachusetts, in 1633, Cole did not appear to be a forceful man, 
did not seem someone capable of confronting Flexner. But he always 
remained true to those things that he had thought out, and his thinking 
was powerful. Then he yielded only to evidence, not to personality, and 
advanced his own ideas calmly and with tenacity. His longtime colleague 
Thomas Rivers called him “a modest man, a rather timid man,” who 
“would go out of his way to dodge” a confrontation. But, Rivers added, 
“He was considered the brightest man that ever graduated from Hopkins 
at the time he graduated. . . .  If  you get  him mad, get him in a corner and 
kind of back him up, . . .  [y]ou would ﬁnd, generally to your sorrow, that 
the old boy wasn’t afraid to ﬁght.” 
Cole had wide interests and late in life wrote a two-volume, 1,294-
page study of Oliver Cromwell, the Stuarts, and the English Civil War. 
"
"81 
The Warriors 
But at the institute lunch table he focused. Heidelberger recalled, “He 
would sit there and listen to whatever was going on, and then he’d ask a 
question. Sometimes the question seemed almost naive for a person who 
was supposed to know as much as he did, but the result always was to 
bring out things that hadn’t been brought out before and to get much 
deeper down into the problem than one had before. Dr. Cole was really 
quite remarkable in that way.” 
His father and two uncles were doctors, and at the Hopkins his pro-
fessor Lewellys Barker had established laboratories next to patient wards 
to study disease, not just conduct diagnostic tests. There Cole had done 
pioneering research. He came away from that experience with ideas that 
would inﬂuence the conduct of “clinical” research—research using 
patients instead of test tubes or animals—to this day. 
Flexner saw the hospital as a testing ground for ideas generated by 
laboratory scientists. The scientists would control experimental thera-
pies. The doctors treating the patients would do little more than play the 
role of a technician caring for a lab animal. 
Cole had other ideas. He would not allow the hospital and its doctors 
to serve, said Rivers, as a “handmaiden. He and his boys were not going to 
test Noguchi’s ideas, Meltzer’s ideas, or Levens’s ideas. Cole was adamant 
that people caring for patients do the research on them.” 
In a letter to the directors Cole explained that the clinicians should be 
full-ﬂedged scientists conducting serious research: “One thing that has 
most seriously delayed the advancement of medicine has been the physi-
cal and intellectual barrier between the laboratory and the wards of many 
of our hospitals. Clinical laboratories most often exist merely to aid diag-
nosis. I would therefore urge that the hospital laboratory be developed as 
a true research laboratory, and that moreover [the doctors] of the hospi-
tal be permitted and urged to undertake experimental work.” 
This was no simple question of turf or bureaucratic power. Cole 
was setting an enormously important precedent. He was calling for— 
demanding—that physicians treating patients undertake rigorous research 
involving patients with disease. Precedents for this kind of work had been 
seen elsewhere, but not in the systematic way Cole envisioned. 
Such studies not only threatened the power of the scientists doing 
purely laboratory research at the institute but, by implication, also 
changed the doctor-patient relationship. They were an admission that 
"
"82 
The Great Influenza 
doctors did not know the answers and could not learn them without the 
patients’ help. Since any rigorous study required a “control,” this also 
meant that random chance, as opposed to the best judgment of the 
physician, might dictate what treatment a patient got. 
Timid of nature or not, Cole would not yield. Flexner did. As a result, 
the Rockefeller Institute Hospital applied science directly to patient care, 
creating the model of clinical research—a model followed today by the 
greatest medical research facility in the world, the Clinical Center at the 
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. That model allowed 
investigators to learn. It also prepared them to act. 
The Rockefeller Institute Hospital opened in 1910. By then the best of 
American medical science and education could compete with the best in 
the world. But an enormous gap existed in the United States between the 
best medical practice and the average, and an unbridgeable chasm sepa-
rated the best from the worst. 
In effect, there were outstanding generals, colonels, and majors, but 
they had no sergeants, corporals, or privates; they had no army to lead, at 
least not a reliable one. The gap between the best and the average had to 
be closed, and the worst had to be eliminated. 
Physicians already practicing were unreachable. They had on their 
own either chosen to adopt scientiﬁc methods or not. Thousands had. 
Simon Flexner himself received his M.D. from a terrible medical school 
but had more than compensated, conﬁrming Welch’s observation: “The 
results were better than the system.” 
But the system of medical education still needed massive reform. 
Calls for reform had begun in the 1820s. Little had been accomplished 
outside a handful of elite schools. 
Even among elite schools change came slowly. Not until 1901 did 
Harvard, followed soon by Penn and Columbia, join the Hopkins in re-
quiring medical students to have a college degree. But even the best schools 
failed to follow the Hopkins’s lead in recruiting quality faculty, instead 
choosing professors in clinical medicine from among local physicians. 
The ofﬁcial history of Penn’s medical school conceded, “Inbreeding of a 
faculty could hardly go farther.” Harvard’s clinical professors were actu-
ally selected by a group of doctors who had no status at Harvard and met 
"
"83 
The Warriors 
at the Tavern Club to make their decisions, which were usually based on 
seniority. Not until 1912 would Harvard select a clinical professor from 
outside this group. 
Pressure did come from within the profession to improve. Not only 
those at the Hopkins, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Harvard, and other lead-
ing medical schools devoted themselves to reform. So did a large number 
of individual physicians and surgeons. In 1904 the American Medical 
Association ﬁnally formed a Council on Medical Education to organize 
the reform movement. The council began inspecting all 162 medical 
schools—more than half of all the medical schools in the world—in the 
United States and Canada. 
Three years later the AMA council issued a blistering—but con-
ﬁdential—report. It concluded that at the better schools improvement 
was occurring, although, despite enormous effort by many reformers, 
not at a rapid enough pace. But the worst schools had barely changed at 
all. Faculty still owned most of them, most still had no connection to a 
university or hospital and no standards for admission, and tuition still 
funded faculty salaries. One school had graduated 105 “doctors” in 1905, 
none of whom had completed any laboratory work whatsoever; they had 
not dissected a single cadaver, nor had they seen a single patient. They 
would wait for a patient to enter their ofﬁce for that experience. 
The report had some effect. Within a year, ﬁfty-seven medical schools 
were requiring at least one year of college of their applicants. But that still 
left two-thirds of the schools with lower or no requirements, and it did 
not address the content of the education itself. 
Unable to confront its own membership again—in 1900 the AMA 
had only eight thousand members out of one hundred ten thousand doc-
tors and feared antagonizing the profession—the AMA gave its report 
to the Carnegie Foundation, insisted that it remain conﬁdential, and 
asked for help. In turn, the Carnegie Foundation commissioned Simon 
Flexner’s brother Abraham to survey medical education. Although not a 
doctor, Flexner had been an undergraduate at the Hopkins—he said that 
even among undergraduates “research was the air we breathed”—and 
had already demonstrated both a ruthless, unforgiving judgment and a 
commitment to advancing model educational institutions. In his ﬁrst job 
after college, he had taught in a Louisville high school—where he failed 
"
"84 
The Great Influenza 
his entire class of ﬁfteen students—and had experimented with new ways 
of teaching. Later he would create the Institute for Advanced Study at 
Princeton, and personally recruit Albert Einstein to it. 
Abraham Flexner began his study by talking at length to Welch and 
Franklin Mall. Their views inﬂuenced him, to say the least. He stated, 
“The rest of my study of medical education was little more than an 
ampliﬁcation of what I had learned during my initial visit to Baltimore.” 
In 1910, the same year the Rockefeller Institute Hospital opened, his 
report Medical Education in the United States and Canada appeared. It 
soon came to be known simply as “The Flexner Report.” 
According to it, few—very, very few—schools met his standards, or 
any reasonable standard. He dismissed many schools as “without redeem-
ing  features  of  any  kind . . .  general squalor . . .  clinical poverty. . . .  [O]ne 
encounters surgery taught without patient, instrument, model, or draw-
ing; recitations in obstetrics without a manikin in sight—often without 
one in the building.” At Temple, at Halifax University, at the Philadelphia 
College of Osteopathy, the dissecting rooms “defy description. The smell 
is intolerable, the cadavers now putrid.” At North Carolina Medical Col-
lege Flexner quoted a faculty member saying,“‘It is idle to talk of real lab-
oratory work for students so ignorant and clumsy. Many of them, gotten 
through advertising, would make better farmers.’” 
Flexner concluded that more than 120 of the 150-plus medical 
schools in operation should be closed. 
It was the Progressive Era. Life was becoming organized, rationalized, 
specialized. In every ﬁeld “professionals” were emerging, routing the 
ideas of the Jacksonian period, when state legislatures deemed that 
licensing even physicians was antidemocratic. Frederick Taylor was creat-
ing the ﬁeld of “scientiﬁc management” to increase efﬁciencies in facto-
ries, and Harvard Business School opened in 1908 to teach it. This 
rationalization of life included national advertising, which was now 
appearing, and retail chains, which were stretching across the continent; 
United Drug Stores the largest, had 6,843 locations. 
But the Flexner report did not merely reﬂect the Progressive Era. Nor 
did it reﬂect the context in which one Marxist historian tried to place sci-
entiﬁc medicine, calling it “a tool developed by members of the medical 
"
"85 
The Warriors 
profession and the corporate class to . . . legitimize” capitalism and shift 
attention from social causes of disease. Noncapitalist societies, including 
Japan, Russia, and China, were adopting scientiﬁc medicine as well. The 
report reﬂected less the Progressive Era than science. Not surprisingly, 
progressives failed in a similar effort to standardize training of lawyers. 
Anyone could read a statute; only a trained specialist could isolate a 
pathogen from someone sick. 
The Progressive Era was, however, also the muckraking era. Flexner’s 
report raked muck and created a sensation. Fifteen thousand copies were 
printed. Newspapers headlined it and investigated local medical schools. 
Flexner received at least one death threat. 
The impact was immediate. Armed now with the outcry Flexner had 
generated, the AMA’s Council on Medical Education began rating schools 
as “Class A” and fully satisfactory; “Class B,” which were “redeemable”; or 
“Class C,” which were “needing complete reorganization.” Schools owned 
and operated by faculty were automatically rated C. 
Less than four years after Flexner’s report was issued, thirty-one states 
denied licensing recognition to new graduates of Class C institutions, 
effectively killing the schools outright. Class B schools had to improve or 
merge. Medical schools at such universities as Nebraska, Colorado, Tufts, 
George Washington, and Georgetown kept a tenuous hold on AMA 
approval but survived. In Baltimore three Class B schools consolidated 
into the present University of Maryland medical school. In Atlanta, 
Emory absorbed two other schools. Medical schools at such institutions 
as Southern Methodist, Drake, Bowdoin, and Fordham simply collapsed. 
By the late 1920s, before the economic pressure of the Depression, 
nearly one hundred medical schools had closed or merged. The number 
of medical students, despite a dramatic increase in the country’s popula-
tion, declined from twenty-eight thousand in 1904 to fewer than four-
teen thousand in 1920; in 1930, despite a further increase in the country’s 
population, the number of medical students was still 25 percent less than 
in 1904. 
Later, Arthur Dean Bevan, leader of the AMA reform effort, insisted, 
“The AMA deserved practically all the credit for the reorganization of med-
ical education in this country. . . .  80% of the Flexner report was taken 
from the work of the Council on Medical Education.” Bevan was wrong. 
"

The Great Influenza 
The AMA wanted to avoid publicity, but only the leverage of the publicity— 
indeed, the scandal—Flexner generated could force change. Without the 
report, reform would have taken years, perhaps decades. And Flexner inﬂu-
enced the direction of change as well. He deﬁned a model. 
The model for the schools that survived was, of course, the Johns 
Hopkins. 
Flexner’s report had indirect impact as well. It greatly accelerated the 
flow, already begun, of philanthropic funds into medical schools. Between 
1902 and 1934, nine major foundations poured $154 million into medi-
cine, nearly half the total funds given away to all causes. And this under-
states the money generated, because the gifts often required the school to 
raise matching funds. This money saved some schools. Yale, for example, 
was rated a weak Class B school but it launched a fund-raising drive and 
increased its endowment from $300,000 to almost $3 million; its operat-
ing budget leaped from $43,000 to $225,000. The states also began pour-
ing money into schools of state universities. 
The largest single donor remained the Rockefeller Foundation. John 
D. Rockefeller himself continued to see a homeopathic physician. 
Welch had turned the Hopkins model into a force. He and colleagues at 
Michigan, at Penn, at Harvard, and at a handful of other schools had in 
effect ﬁrst formed an elite group of senior ofﬁcers of an army; then, in an 
amazingly brief time, they had revolutionized American medicine, cre-
ated and expanded the ofﬁcer corps, and begun training their army, an 
army of scientists and scientiﬁcally grounded physicians. 
On the eve of America’s entry into World War I, Welch had one more 
goal. In 1884, when the Hopkins ﬁrst offered Welch his position, he had 
urged the establishment of a separate school to study public health in a 
scientiﬁc manner. Public health was and is where the largest numbers of 
lives are saved, usually by understanding the epidemiology of a disease— 
its patterns, where and how it emerges and spreads—and attacking it at 
its weak points. This usually means prevention. Science had ﬁrst con-
tained smallpox, then cholera, then typhoid, then plague, then yellow 
fever, all through large-scale public health measures, everything from ﬁl-
tering water to testing and killing rats to vaccination. Public health mea-
sures lack the drama of pulling someone back from the edge of death, but 
they save lives by the millions. 
"
"87 
The Warriors 
Welch had put that goal aside while he focused on transforming 
American medicine, on making it science-based. Now he began to pursue 
that goal again, suggesting to the Rockefeller Foundation that it fund a 
school of public health. 
There was competition to get this institution, and others tried to con-
vince the foundation that though creating a school of public health made 
good sense, putting it in Baltimore did not. In 1916, Harvard president 
Charles Eliot wrote bluntly to the foundation—and simultaneously paid 
Welch a supreme compliment—when he dismissed the entire Hopkins 
medical school as “one man’s work in a new and small university. . . . The  
more I consider the project of placing the Institute of Hygiene at Balti-
more, the less suitable expedient I ﬁnd it. . . . In comparison with either 
Boston or New York, it conspicuously lacks public spirit and beneﬁcent 
community action. The personality and career of Dr. Welch are the sole 
argument for putting it in Baltimore—and he is almost 66 years old and 
will have no similar successor.” 
Nonetheless, that “sole argument” sufﬁced. The Johns Hopkins 
School of Hygiene and Public Health was scheduled to open October 1, 
1918. Welch had resigned as a professor at the medical school to be its 
ﬁrst dean. 
The study of epidemic disease is, of course, a prime focus of public 
health. 
Welch was sick the day of the scheduled opening, and getting sicker. 
He had recently returned from a trip to investigate a strange and deadly 
epidemic. His symptoms were identical to those of the victims of that 
epidemic, and he believed he too had the disease. 
The army Welch had created was designed to attack, to seek out partic-
ular targets, if only targets of opportunity, and kill them. On October 1, 
1918, the abilities of that army were about to be tested by the deadliest 
epidemic in human history.

askell County, Kansas, lies west of Dodge City, where cattle 
drives up from Texas reached a railhead, and belongs geographi-
cally to and, in 1918, not far in time from, the truly Wild West. The land-
scape was and is ﬂat and treeless, and the county was, literally, of the 
earth. Sod houses built of earth were still common then, and even one of 
the county’s few post ofﬁces was located in the dug-out sod home of the 
postmaster, who once a week collected the mail by riding his horse forty 
miles round-trip to the county seat in Santa Fe, a smattering of a few 
wooden buildings that was already well on its way to becoming the ghost 
town it would be in another ten years—today only its cemetery remains 
as a sign of its existence. But other towns nearby did have life. In 
Copeland, Stebbins Cash Store sold groceries, shoes, dry goods, dishes, 
hardware, implements, paints, and oils, while in Sublette, in the absence 
of a bank, S. E. Cave loaned money on real estate for 7.5 percent. 
Here land, crops, and livestock were everything, and the smell of 
manure meant civilization. Farmers lived in close proximity to hogs and 
fowl, with cattle, pigs, and poultry everywhere. There were plenty of dogs 
too, and owners made sure to teach their dogs not to chase someone else’s 
cattle; that could get them shot. 
It was a land of extremes. It was dry enough that the bed of the 
Cimarron River often lay cracked and barren of water, dry enough that 
the front page of the local newspaper proclaimed in February 1918, “A

slow rain fell all day, measuring 27 one hundredths. It was well appreci-
ated.” Yet torrential rains sometimes brought ﬂoods, such as the one in 
1914 that drowned ranchers and wiped out the ﬁrst and largest perma-
nent business in the area, a ranch that ran thirty thousand head of cattle. 
In summer the sun bleached the prairie, parching it under a heat that 
made light itself quiver. In winter unearthly gales swept unopposed 
across the plains for hundreds of miles, driving the windchill past ﬁfty 
degrees below zero; then the country seemed as frozen and empty as the 
Russian steppes. And storms, violent storms, from tornadoes to literally 
blinding blizzards, plagued the region. But all these extremes of nature 
came every season. Another extreme of nature came only once. 
Epidemiological evidence suggests that a new inﬂuenza virus origi-
nated in Haskell County, Kansas, early in 1918. Evidence further suggests 
that this virus traveled east across the state to a huge army base, and from 
there to Europe. Later it began its sweep through North America, through 
Europe, through South America, through Asia and Africa, through iso-
lated islands in the Paciﬁc, through all the wide world. In its wake followed 
a keening sound that rose from the throats of mourners like the wind. 
The evidence comes from Dr. Loring Miner. 
Loring Miner was an unusual man. A graduate of the oldest university in 
the West, Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, a classicist enamored of ancient 
Greece, he had come in 1885 to this region. Despite a background so 
unlike those of his fellow frontiersmen, he had taken to the country and 
done well. 
Miner was a big man in many ways: physically large, with angular 
features and a handlebar mustache, gruff, someone who didn’t suffer 
fools—especially when he drank, which was often. A certain rebellious-
ness was part of his bigness as well. He hadn’t seen the inside of a church 
in years. Periodically he reread the classics in Greek but he ate peas with 
his knife. And in thirty years on that prairie he had built a small empire 
apart from medicine. In the Odd Fellows he was a past noble grand, he 
had chaired the county Democratic Party, had been county coroner, was 
county health ofﬁcer. He owned a drugstore and grocery and expected 
his patients to buy from him, and he married into the family of the 
largest landowners in western Kansas. Even in Haskell there was a social 
order, and now, during the war, his wife used her social standing as head 
"
"93 
The Swarm 
of the county Red Cross Woman’s Work Committee. When she asked for 
something few said no to her, and most women in the county did Red 
Cross work—real work, hard work, almost as hard as farmwork. 
But Miner also personiﬁed Welch’s comment that the results of med-
ical education were better than the system. Although an isolated country 
doctor who began practicing before the establishment of the germ theory 
of disease, he had quickly accepted it, kept up with the astounding 
advances in his profession, built a laboratory in his ofﬁce, learned how to 
use the new antitoxins for diphtheria and tetanus. By 1918 one of his sons 
had also become a doctor with a fully scientiﬁc education, and was 
already in the navy. He prided himself on his own scientiﬁc knowledge 
and puzzled over problems. His patients said they’d rather have him 
drunk than someone else sober. 
His practice ranged over hundreds of square miles. Perhaps that was 
what Miner liked about it, the great expanse, the extremes, the lonely 
wind that could turn as violent as a gunshot, the hours spent making his 
way to a patient, sometimes in a horse and buggy, sometimes by car, 
sometimes by train—conductors would hold the train for him, and in 
winter stationmasters would violate the rules and let him wait inside the 
ofﬁce by the stove. 
But in late January and early February 1918, Miner had other con-
cerns. One patient presented with what seemed common symptoms, 
although with unusual intensity—violent headache and body aches, high 
fever, nonproductive cough. Then another. And another. In Satanta, in 
Sublette, in Santa Fe, in Jean, in Copeland, on isolated farms. 
Miner had seen inﬂuenza often. He diagnosed the disease as inﬂuenza. 
But he had never seen inﬂuenza like this. This was violent, rapid in its 
progress through the body, and sometimes lethal. This inﬂuenza killed. 
Soon dozens of his patients—the strongest, the healthiest, the most 
robust people in the county—were being struck down as suddenly as if 
they had been shot. 
Miner turned all his energies to this disease. He drew blood, urine, 
and sputum samples, and used the laboratory skills his son had helped 
him improve. He searched all his medical texts and journals. He called his 
few colleagues in that part of the state. He contacted the U.S. Public 
Health Service, which offered him neither assistance nor advice. Mean-
while he likely did what little he could, trying diphtheria antitoxin with

no effect, perhaps even trying tetanus antitoxin—anything that might 
stimulate the body’s immune system against disease. 
The local paper, the Santa Fe Monitor, apparently worried about hurt-
ing morale in wartime, said little about deaths but on inside pages 
reported, “Mrs. Eva Van Alstine is sick with pneumonia. Her little son 
Roy is now able to get up. . . .  Ralph Lindeman is still quite sick. . . .  
Goldie Wolgehagen is working at the Beeman store during her sister Eva’s 
sickness. . . . Homer Moody  has been reported quite sick. . . . Mertin,  the  
young son of Ernest Elliot, is sick with pneumonia. . . . We are  pleased to 
report that Pete Hesser’s children are recovering nicely. . . .  Mrs J. S. Cox 
is some better but is very weak yet. . . .  Ralph McConnell has been quite 
sick this week.” 
By now the disease overwhelmed Miner with patients. He pushed 
everything else aside, slept sometimes in his buggy while the horse made 
its own way home—one advantage over the automobile—through 
frozen nights. Perhaps he wondered if he was being confronted with the 
Plague of Athens, a mysterious disease that devastated the city during the 
Peloponnesian Wars, killing possibly one-third the population. 
Then the disease disappeared. By mid-March the schools reopened 
with healthy children. Men and women returned to work. And the war 
regained its hold on people’s thoughts. 
The disease still, however, troubled Miner deeply. It also frightened 
him, not only for his own people but for the people beyond. Inﬂuenza 
was neither a “reportable” disease—not a disease that the law required 
physicians to report—nor a disease that any state or federal public health 
agency tracked. 
Yet Miner considered his experience so unusual, and this eruption of 
the disease so dangerous, that he formally warned national public health 
ofﬁcials about it. 
Public Health Reports was a weekly journal published by the U.S. Pub-
lic Health Service to alert health ofﬁcials to outbreaks of all communica-
ble diseases, not only in North America and Europe but anywhere in the 
world—in Saigon, Bombay, Madagascar, Quito. It tracked not just deadly 
diseases such as yellow fever and plague but far lesser threats; especially in 
the United States, it tracked mumps, chickenpox, and measles. 
In the ﬁrst six months of 1918, Miner’s warning of “inﬂuenza of

The Swarm 
severe type” was the only reference in that journal to inﬂuenza anywhere 
in the world. Other medical journals that spring carried articles on 
inﬂuenza outbreaks, but they all occurred after Haskell’s, and they were 
not issued as public health warnings. Haskell County remains the ﬁrst 
outbreak in 1918 suggesting that a new inﬂuenza virus was adapting, vio-
lently, to man. 
As it turned out, the death rate in Haskell as a percentage of the entire 
county’s population was only a fraction of what the death rate for the 
United States would be later that year, when inﬂuenza struck in full force. 
People suffering from inﬂuenza shed virus—expel viruses that can 
infect others—for usually no more than seven days after infection and 
often even less. After that, although they may continue to cough and 
sneeze, they will not spread the disease. As sparsely populated and iso-
lated as Haskell was, the virus infecting the county might well have died 
there, might well have failed to spread to the outside world. That would 
be so except for one thing: this was wartime. 
The same week that Homer Moody and a dozen others in Jean, 
Kansas, fell ill, a young soldier named Dean Nilson came home to Jean on 
leave from Camp Funston, located three hundred miles away within the 
vast Fort Riley military reservation. The Santa Fe Monitor noted, “Dean 
looks like soldier life agrees with him.” After his leave, of course, he returned 
to the camp. Ernest Elliot left Sublette, in Haskell County, to visit his 
brother at Funston just as his child fell ill; by the time Elliot returned 
home, the child had pneumonia. Of nearby Copeland on February 21, 
the paper said, “Most everybody over the country is having lagrippe or 
pneumonia.” On February 28 it reported that John Bottom just left 
Copeland for Funston: “We predict John will make an ideal soldier.” 
Camp Funston, the second-largest cantonment in the country, held on 
average ﬁfty-six thousand green young troops. The camp was built at the 
conﬂuence of the Smoky Hill and Republican Rivers, where they form 
the Kansas River. Like all the other training camps in the country, Fun-
ston had been thrown together in literally a few weeks in 1917. There the 
army prepared young men for war. 
It was a typical camp, with typical tensions between army regulars 
and men who had until recently been civilians. When Major John Donnelly 
"
"96 
The Great Influenza 
was stopped by military police for speeding, for example, he defended 
himself to the commanding general: “I have, on a few occasions, corrected 
(enlisted) personnel along the road parallel to that camp for failure to 
salute; cases that I could not conscientiously overlook, there being no 
excuse whatever for their failure to do so. This, like my attempted correc-
tion of this guard, may not have been taken in the proper spirit, resulting 
in a feeling of insubordinate revenge and animosity towards me by mem-
bers of this organization.” 
There were also the usual clashes of egos, especially since Camp Fun-
ston and Fort Riley had different commanding ofﬁcers. These clashes 
ended when Major General C. G. Ballou, who commanded the canton-
ment, sent a missive to Washington. He had developed what he described 
as a “training ground for specialists” at Smoky Hill Flat. In fact, Smoky 
Hill Flat was the best of three polo ﬁelds on the base. The commanding 
ofﬁcer of Fort Riley, only a colonel, established the post dump beside it. 
The general requested and received authority “to exercise command over 
the entire reservation of Fort Riley,” and the colonel was relieved of his 
command. 
Funston was typical in another way. The winter of 1917–18 was one of 
record cold, and, as the army itself conceded, at Funston as elsewhere 
“barracks and tents were overcrowded and inadequately heated, and it 
was impossible to supply the men with sufﬁcient warm clothing.” 
So army regulations—written for health reasons—detailing how much 
space each man should have were violated, and men were stacked in bunks 
with insufﬁcient clothing and bedding and inadequate heating. That forced 
them to huddle ever more closely together around stoves. 
Men inducted into the army from Haskell County trained at Funston. 
There was a small but constant ﬂow of trafﬁc between the two places. 
On March 4 a private at Funston, a cook, reported ill with inﬂuenza at 
sick call. Within three weeks more than eleven hundred soldiers were sick 
enough to be admitted to the hospital, and thousands more—the precise 
number was not recorded—needed treatment at inﬁrmaries scattered 
around the base. Pneumonia developed in 237 men, roughly 20 percent 
of those hospitalized, but only thirty-eight men died. While that was a 
higher death toll than one would normally expect from inﬂuenza, it was 
not so high as to draw attention, much less than the death rate in Haskell, 
and only a tiny fraction of the death rate to come. 
"
"97

All inﬂuenza viruses mutate constantly. The timing of the Funston 
explosion strongly suggests that the inﬂuenza outbreak there came from 
Haskell; if Haskell was the source, whoever carried it to Funston brought 
a mild version of the virus, but it was a version capable of mutating back 
to lethality. 
Meanwhile Funston fed a constant stream of men to other American 
bases and to Europe, men whose business was killing. They would be 
more proﬁcient at it than they could imagine.

o one will ever know with absolute certainty whether the 
1918–19 inﬂuenza pandemic actually did originate in Haskell 
County, Kansas. There are other theories of origin. (For a fuller discus-
sion of them see pages 453 through 456.) But Frank Macfarlane Burnet, 
a Nobel laureate who lived through the pandemic and spent most of his 
scientiﬁc career studying inﬂuenza, later concluded that the evidence was 
“strongly suggestive” that the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic began in the 
United States, and that its spread was “intimately related to war condi-
tions and especially the arrival of American troops in France.” Numerous 
other scientists agree with him. And the evidence does strongly suggest 
that Camp Funston experienced the ﬁrst major outbreak of inﬂuenza in 
America; if so, the movement of men from an inﬂuenza-infested Haskell 
to Funston also strongly suggests Haskell as the site of origin. 
Regardless of where it began, to understand what happened next one 
must ﬁrst understand viruses and the concept of the mutant swarm. 
Viruses are themselves an enigma that exist on the edges of life. They 
are not simply small bacteria. Bacteria consist of only one cell, but they 
are fully alive. Each has a metabolism, requires food, produces waste, and 
reproduces by division. 
Viruses do not eat or burn oxygen for energy. They do not engage in 
any process that could be considered metabolic. They do not produce 
waste. They do not have sex. They make no side products, by accident or 
"
"99 
The Swarm 
design. They do not even reproduce independently. They are less than a 
fully living organism but more than an inert collection of chemicals. 
Several theories of their origin exist, and these theories are not mutu-
ally exclusive. Evidence exists to support all of them, and different viruses 
may have developed in different ways. 
A minority view suggests that viruses originated independently as the 
most primitive molecules capable of replicating themselves. If this is so, 
more advanced life forms could have evolved from them. 
More virologists think the opposite: that viruses began as more com-
plex living cells and evolved—or, more accurately, devolved—into sim-
pler organisms. This theory does seem to ﬁt some organisms, such as the 
“rickettsia” family of pathogens. Rickettsia used to be considered viruses 
but are now thought of as halfway between bacteria and viruses; research-
ers believe they once possessed but lost activities necessary for independent 
life. The leprosy bacillus also seems to have moved from complexity— 
doing many things—toward simplicity—doing fewer. A third theory ar-
gues that viruses were once part of a cell, an organelle, but broke away and 
began to evolve independently. 
Whatever the origin, a virus has only one function: to replicate itself. 
But unlike other life forms (if a virus is considered a life form), a virus 
does not even do that itself. It invades cells that have energy and then, like 
some alien puppet master, it subverts them, takes them over, forces them 
to make thousands, and in some cases hundreds of thousands, of new 
viruses. The power to do this lies in their genes. 
In most life forms, genes are stretched out along the length of a ﬁlament-
like molecule of DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid. But many viruses—including 
inﬂuenza, HIV, and the coronavirus that causes SARS (Severe Acute Res-
piratory Syndrome)—encode their genes in RNA, ribonucleic acid, an 
even simpler but less stable molecule. 
Genes resemble software; just as a sequence of bits in a computer code 
tells the computer what to do—whether to run a word processing program, 
a computer game, or an Internet search, genes tell the cell what to do. 
Computer code is a binary language: it has only two letters. The genetic 
code uses a language of four letters, each representing the chemicals ade-
nine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine (in some cases uracil substitutes for 
thymine). 
"
"100 
The Great Influenza 
DNA and RNA are strings of these chemicals. In effect they are very 
long sequences of letters. Sometimes these letters do not form words or 
sentences that make any known sense: in fact, 97 percent of human DNA 
does not contain genes and is referred to as “nonsense” or “junk” DNA. 
But when the letters spell out words and sentences that do make 
sense, then that sequence is by deﬁnition a gene. 
When a gene in a cell is activated, it orders the cell to make particular 
proteins. Proteins can be used like bricks as building blocks of tissue. 
(The proteins that one eats generally do end up building tissue.) But pro-
teins also play crucial roles in most chemical reactions within the body, as 
well as in carrying messages to start and stop different processes. Adren-
aline, for example, is a hormone but also a protein; it accelerates the heart 
to create the ﬁght-or-ﬂight response. 
When a virus successfully invades a cell, it inserts its own genes into 
the cell’s genome, and the viral genes seize control from the cell’s own 
genes. The cell’s internal machinery then begins producing what the viral 
genes demand instead of what the cell needs for itself. 
So the cell turns out hundreds of thousands of viral proteins, which bind 
together with copies of the viral genome to form new viruses. Then the new 
viruses escape. In this process the host cell almost always dies, usually when 
the new viral particles burst through the cell surface to invade other cells. 
But if viruses perform only one task, they are not simple. Nor are they 
primitive. Highly evolved, elegant in their focus, more efﬁcient at what 
they do than any fully living being, they have become nearly perfect 
infectious organisms. And the inﬂuenza virus is among the most perfect 
of these perfect organisms. 
Louis Sullivan, the ﬁrst great modern architect, declared that form fol-
lows function. 
To understand viruses, or for that matter to understand biology, one 
must think as Sullivan did, in a language not of words, which simply 
name things, but in a language of three dimensions, a language of shape 
and form. 
For in biology, especially at the cellular and molecular levels, nearly all 
activity depends ultimately upon form, upon physical structure—upon 
what is called “stereochemistry.” 
"
"The Swarm 
101 
The language is written in an alphabet of pyramids, cones, spikes, 
mushrooms, blocks, hydras, umbrellas, spheres, ribbons twisted into 
every imaginable Escher-like fold, and in fact every shape imaginable. 
Each form is deﬁned in exquisite and absolutely precise detail, and each 
carries a message. 
Basically everything in the body—whether it belongs there or not— 
either carries a form on its surface, a marking, a piece that identiﬁes it as 
a unique entity, or its entire form and being comprises that message. (In this 
last case, it is pure information, pure message, and it embodies perfectly 
Marshall McLuhan’s observation that “the medium is the message.”) 
Reading the message, like reading braille, is an intimate act, an act of 
contact and sensitivity. Everything in the body communicates in this way, 
sending and receiving messages by contact. 
This communication occurs in much the same way that a round peg 
ﬁts into a round hole. When they ﬁt together, when they match each 
other in size, the peg “binds” to the hole. Although the various shapes in 
the body are usually more complex than a round peg, the concept is the 
same. 
Within the body, cells, proteins, viruses, and everything else con-
stantly bump against one another and make physical contact. When one 
protuberance ﬁts the other not at all, each moves on. Nothing happens. 
But when one complements the other, the act becomes increasingly 
intimate; if they ﬁt together well enough, they “bind.” Sometimes they ﬁt 
as loosely as the round peg in the round hole, in which case they may sep-
arate; sometimes they ﬁt more snugly, like a skeleton key in a simple lock 
on a closet door; sometimes they ﬁt with exquisite precision, like a varie-
gated key in a far more secure lock. 
Then events unfold. Things change. The body reacts. The results of 
this binding can be as dramatic, or destructive, as any act of sex or love or 
hate or violence. 
There are three different types of inﬂuenza viruses: A, B, and C. Type C 
rarely causes disease in humans. Type B does cause disease, but not epi-
demics. Only inﬂuenza A viruses cause epidemics or pandemics, an epi-
demic being a local or national outbreak, a pandemic a worldwide one. 
Inﬂuenza viruses did not originate in humans. Their natural home is

The Great Influenza 
in birds, and many more variants of inﬂuenza viruses exist in birds than 
in humans. But the disease is considerably different in birds and humans. 
In birds, the virus infects the gastrointestinal tract. Bird droppings 
contain large amounts of virus, and infectious virus can contaminate 
cold lakes and other water supplies. 
Massive exposure to an avian virus can infect man directly, but an 
avian virus cannot go from person to person. It cannot, that is, unless it 
ﬁrst changes, unless it ﬁrst adapts to humans. 
This happens rarely, but it does happen. The virus may also go through 
an intermediary mammal, especially swine, and jump from swine to man. 
Whenever a new variant of the inﬂuenza virus does adapt to humans, it will 
threaten to spread rapidly across the world. It will threaten a pandemic. 
Pandemics often come in waves, and the cumulative “morbidity” rate— 
the number of people who get sick in all the waves combined—often 
exceeds 50 percent. One virologist considers inﬂuenza so infectious that 
he calls it “a special instance” among infectious diseases, “transmitted so 
effectively that it exhausts the supply of susceptible hosts.” 
Inﬂuenza and other viruses—not bacteria—combine to cause approx-
imately 90 percent of all respiratory infections, including sore throats.* 
Coronaviruses (the cause of the common cold as well as SARS), 
parainﬂuenza viruses, and many other viruses all cause symptoms akin 
to inﬂuenza, and all are often confused with it. As a result, sometimes 
people designate mild respiratory infections as “ﬂu” and dismiss them. 
But inﬂuenza is not simply a bad cold. It is a quite speciﬁc disease, 
with a distinct set of symptoms and epidemiological behavior. In humans 
the virus directly attacks only the respiratory system, and it becomes 
increasingly dangerous as it penetrates deeper into the lungs. Indirectly it 
affects many parts of the body, and even a mild infection can cause pain 
in muscles and joints, intense headache, and prostration. It may also lead 
to far more grave complications. 
The overwhelming majority of inﬂuenza victims usually recover fully 
within ten days. Partly because of this, and partly because the disease is 
confused with the common cold, inﬂuenza is rarely viewed with concern. 
*Nonetheless, people today often demand antibiotics from physicians and the 
physicians too often accommodate them. But antibiotics have no effect whatsoever on 
viruses. Administering them serves only to increase resistance to antibiotics by bacte-
ria: bacteria that survive exposure to antibiotics become immune to them.

Yet even when outbreaks are not deadly as a whole, inﬂuenza strikes 
so many people that even the mildest viruses almost always kill. Cur-
rently in the United States, even without an epidemic or pandemic, the 
Centers for Disease Control estimates that inﬂuenza kills on average 
36,000 people a year. 
It is, however, not only an endemic disease, a disease that is always 
around. It also arrives in epidemic and pandemic form. And pandemics 
can be more lethal—sometimes much, much more lethal—than en-
demic disease. 
Throughout known history there have been periodic pandemics of 
inﬂuenza, usually several a century. They erupt when a new inﬂuenza 
virus emerges. And the nature of the inﬂuenza virus makes it inevitable 
that new viruses emerge. 
The virus itself is nothing more than a membrane—a sort of envelope— 
that contains the genome, the eight genes that deﬁne what the virus is. It 
is usually spherical (it can take other shapes), about 1/10,000 of a mil-
limeter in diameter, and it looks something like a dandelion with a forest 
of two differently shaped protuberances—one roughly like a spike, the 
other roughly like a tree—jutting out from its surface. 
These protuberances provide the virus with its actual mechanism of 
attack. That attack, and the defensive war the body wages, is typical of 
how shape and form determine outcomes. 
The protuberances akin to spikes are hemagglutinin. When the virus 
collides with the cell, the hemagglutinin brushes against molecules of 
sialic acid that jut out from the surface of cells in the respiratory tract. 
Hemagglutinin and sialic acid have shapes that ﬁt snugly together, 
and the hemagglutinin binds to the sialic acid “receptor” like a hand going 
into a glove. As the virus sits against the cell membrane, more spikes of 
hemagglutinin bind to more sialic acid receptors; they work like grap-
pling hooks thrown by pirates onto a vessel, lashing it fast. Once this 
binding holds the virus and cell fast, the virus has achieved its ﬁrst task: 
“adsorption,” adherence to the body of the target cell. 
This step marks the beginning of the end for the cell, and the begin-
ning of a successful invasion by the virus. 
Soon a pit forms in the cell membrane beneath the virus, and the 
virus slips through the pit to enter entirely within the cell in a kind of 
"
"104 
The Great Influenza 
bubble called a “vesicle.” (If for some reason the inﬂuenza virus cannot 
penetrate the cell membrane, it can detach itself and then bind to another 
cell that it can penetrate. Few other viruses can do this.) 
By entering the cell, as opposed to fusing with the cell on the cell 
membrane—which many other viruses do—the inﬂuenza virus hides 
from the immune system. The body’s defenses cannot ﬁnd it and kill it. 
Inside this vesicle, this bubble, shape and form shift and create new 
possibilities as the hemagglutinin faces a more acidic environment. This 
acidity makes it cleave in two and refold itself into an entirely different 
shape. The refolding process somewhat resembles taking a sock off a foot, 
turning it inside out, and sticking a ﬁst in it. The cell is now doomed. 
The newly exposed part of the hemagglutinin interacts with the vesi-
cle, and the membrane of the virus begins to dissolve. Virologists call this 
the “uncoating” of the virus and “fusion” with the cell. Soon the genes of 
the virus spill into the cell, then penetrate to the cell nucleus, insert them-
selves into the cell’s genome, displace some of the cell’s own genes, and 
begin issuing orders. The cell begins to produce viral proteins instead of 
its own. Within a few hours these proteins are packaged with new copies 
of the viral genes. 
Meanwhile, the spikes of neuraminidase, the other protuberance that 
jutted out from the surface of the virus, are performing another function. 
Electron micrographs show neuraminidase to have a boxlike head ex-
tending from a thin stalk, and attached to the head are what look like four 
identical six-bladed propellers. The neuraminidase breaks up the sialic 
acid remaining on the cell surface. This destroys the acid’s ability to bind 
to inﬂuenza viruses. 
This is crucial. Otherwise, when new viruses burst from the cell they 
could be caught as if on ﬂy paper; they might bind to and be trapped by 
sialic acid receptors on the dead cell’s disintegrating membrane. The neur-
aminidase guarantees that new viruses can escape to invade other cells. 
Again, few other viruses do anything similar. 
From the time an inﬂuenza virus ﬁrst attaches to a cell to the time the 
cell bursts generally takes about ten hours, although it can take less time 
or, more rarely, longer. Then a swarm of between 100,000 and 1 million 
new inﬂuenza viruses escapes the exploded cell. 
The word “swarm” ﬁts in more ways than one.

Whenever an organism reproduces, its genes try to make exact copies of 
themselves. But sometimes mistakes—mutations—occur in this process. 
This is true whether the genes belong to people, plants, or viruses. The 
more advanced the organism, however, the more mechanisms exist to 
prevent mutations. A person mutates at a much slower rate than bacteria, 
bacteria mutates at a much slower rate than a virus—and a DNA virus 
mutates at a much slower rate than an RNA virus. 
DNA has a kind of built-in proofreading mechanism to cut down on 
copying mistakes. RNA has no proofreading mechanism whatsoever, no 
way to protect against mutation. So viruses that use RNA to carry their 
genetic information mutate much faster—from 10,000 to 1 million times 
faster—than any DNA virus. 
Different RNA viruses mutate at different rates as well. A few mutate 
so rapidly that virologists consider them not so much a population of 
copies of the same virus as what they call a “quasi species” or a “mutant 
swarm.” 
These mutant swarms contain trillions and trillions of closely related 
but different viruses. Even the viruses produced from a single cell will 
include many different versions of themselves, and the swarm as a whole 
will routinely contain almost every possible permutation of its genetic 
code. 
Most of these mutations interfere with the functioning of the virus 
and will either destroy the virus outright or destroy its ability to infect. 
But other mutations, sometimes in a single base, a single letter, in its 
genetic code will allow the virus to adapt rapidly to a new situation. It 
is this adaptability that explains why these quasi species, these mu-
tant swarms, can move rapidly back and forth between different envi-
ronments and also develop extraordinarily rapid drug resistance. As 
one investigator has observed, the rapid mutation “confers a certain 
randomness to the disease processes that accompany RNA [viral] in-
fections.” 
Inﬂuenza is an RNA virus. So is HIV and the coronavirus. And of all 
RNA viruses, inﬂuenza and HIV are among those that mutate the fastest. 
The inﬂuenza virus mutates so fast that 99 percent of the 100,000 to 1 
million new viruses that burst out of a cell in the reproduction process

The Great Influenza 
are too defective to infect another cell and reproduce again. But that still 
leaves between 1,000 and 10,000 viruses that can infect another cell. 
Both inﬂuenza and HIV ﬁt the concept of a quasi species, of a mutant 
swarm. In both, a drug-resistant mutation can emerge within days. And the 
inﬂuenza virus reproduces rapidly—far faster than HIV. Therefore it adapts 
rapidly as well, often too rapidly for the immune system to respond.

n infection is an act of violence; it is an invasion, a rape, and the 
body reacts violently. John Hunter, the great physiologist of the 
eighteenth century, deﬁned life as the ability to resist putrefaction, resist 
infection. Even if one disagrees with that deﬁnition, resisting putrefac-
tion certainly does deﬁne the ability to live. 
The body’s defender is its immune system, an extraordinarily com-
plex, intricate, and interwoven combination of various kinds of white 
blood cells, antibodies, enzymes, toxins, and other proteins. The key to 
the immune system is its ability to distinguish what belongs in the body, 
“self,” from what does not belong, “nonself.” This ability depends, again, 
upon reading the language of shape and form. 
The components of the immune system—white blood cells, enzymes, 
antibodies, and other elements—circulate throughout the body, penetrat-
ing everywhere. When they collide with other cells or proteins or organ-
isms, they interact with and read physical markings and structures just as 
the inﬂuenza virus does when it searches for, ﬁnds, and latches on to a cell. 
Anything carrying a “self” marking, the immune system leaves alone. 
(It does, that is, when the system works properly. “Autoimmune diseases” 
such as lupus or multiple sclerosis develop when the immune system attacks 
its own body.) But if the immune system feels a “nonself” marking— 
either foreign invaders or the body’s own cells that have become diseased— 
it responds. In fact, it attacks. 
"
"108 
The Great Influenza 
The physical markings that the immune system feels and reads and 
then binds to are called “antigens.” The word refers to, very simply, any-
thing that stimulates the immune system to respond. 
Some elements of the immune system, such as so-called natural killer 
cells, will attack anything that bears any nonself-marking, any foreign 
antigen. This is referred to as “innate” or “nonspeciﬁc” immunity, and it 
serves as a ﬁrst line of defense that counterattacks within hours of infection. 
But the bulk of the immune system is far more targeted, far more 
focused, far more speciﬁc. Antibodies, for example, carry thousands of 
receptors on their surface to recognize and bind to a target antigen. Each 
one of those thousands of receptors is identical. So antibodies bearing 
these receptors will recognize and bind only to, for example, a virus bear-
ing that antigen. They will not bind to any other invading organism. 
One link between the nonspeciﬁc and speciﬁc immune response is a 
particular and rare kind of white blood cell called a dendritic cell. Den-
dritic cells attack bacteria and viruses indiscriminately, engulf them, then 
“process” their antigens and “present” those antigens—in effect they 
chop up an invading microorganism into pieces and display the antigens 
like a trophy ﬂag. 
The dendritic cells then travel to the spleen or the lymph nodes, 
where large numbers of other white blood cells concentrate. There these 
other white blood cells learn to recognize the antigen as a foreign invader 
and begin the process of producing huge numbers of antibodies and 
killer white cells that will attack the target antigen and anything attached 
to the antigen. 
The recognition of a foreign antigen also sets off a parallel chain of 
events as the body releases enzymes. Some of these affect the entire body, 
for example, raising its temperature and causing fever. Others directly 
attack and kill the target. Still others serve as chemical messengers, sum-
moning white blood cells to areas of invasion or dilating capillaries so 
killer cells can exit the bloodstream at the point of attack. Swelling, red-
ness, and fever are all side effects of the release of these chemicals. 
All this together is called the “immune response,” and once the 
immune system is mobilized it is formidable indeed. But all this takes 
time. The delay can allow infections to gain a foothold in the body, even 
to advance in raging cadres that can kill. 
"
"The Swarm 
109 
In the days before antibiotics, an infection launched a race to the 
death between the pathogen and the immune system. Sometimes a vic-
tim would become desperately ill; then, suddenly and almost miracu-
lously, the fever would break and the victim would recover. This 
“resolution by crisis” occurred when the immune system barely won the 
race, when it counterattacked massively and successfully. 
But once the body survives an infection, it gains an advantage. For the 
immune system epitomizes the saying that that which does not kill you 
makes you stronger. 
After it defeats an infection, specialized white cells (called “memory T 
cells”) and antibodies that bind to the antigen remain in the body. If any 
invader carrying the same antigen attacks again, the immune system 
responds far more quickly than the ﬁrst time. When the immune system 
can respond so quickly that a new infection will not even cause symp-
toms, people become immune to the disease. 
Vaccinations expose people to an antigen and mobilize the immune 
system to respond to that disease. In modern medicine some vaccines 
contain only the antigen, some contain whole killed pathogens, and some 
contain living but weakened ones. They all alert the immune system and 
allow the body to mount an immediate response if anything bearing that 
antigen invades the body. 
The same process occurs in the body naturally with the inﬂuenza 
virus. After people recover from the disease, their immune systems will 
very quickly target the antigens on the virus that infected them. 
But inﬂuenza has a way to evade the immune system. 
The chief antigens of the inﬂuenza virus are the hemagglutinin and neur-
aminidase protruding from its surface. But of all the parts of the inﬂuenza 
virus that mutate, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase mutate the 
fastest. This makes it impossible for the immune system to keep pace. 
By no means do the antigens of all viruses, even all RNA viruses, 
mutate rapidly. Measles is an RNA virus and mutates at roughly the same 
rate as inﬂuenza. Yet measles antigens do not change. Other parts of the 
virus do, but the antigens remain constant. (The most likely reason is that 
the part of the measles virus that the immune system recognizes as an 
antigen plays an integral role in the function of the virus itself. If it changes 
"
"110 
The Great Influenza 
shape, the virus cannot survive.) So a single exposure to measles usually 
gives lifetime immunity. 
Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, however, can shift into different 
forms and still function. The result: their mutations allow them to evade 
the immune system but do not destroy the virus. In fact, they mutate so 
rapidly that even during a single epidemic both the hemagglutinin and 
neuraminidase often change. 
Sometimes the mutations cause changes so minor that the immune 
system can still recognize them, bind to them, and easily overcome a sec-
ond infection from the same virus. 
But sometimes mutations change the shape of the hemagglutinin or 
neuraminidase enough that the immune system can’t read them. The anti-
bodies that bound perfectly to the old shapes do not ﬁt well to the new one. 
This phenomenon happens so often it has a name: “antigen drift.” 
When antigen drift occurs, the virus can gain a foothold even in 
people whose immune system has loaded itself with antibodies that bind 
to the older shapes. Obviously, the greater the change, the less efﬁciently 
the immune system can respond. 
One way to conceptualize antigen drift is to think of a football player 
wearing a uniform with white pants, a green shirt, and a white helmet 
with a green V emblazoned on it. The immune system can recognize this 
uniform instantly and attack it. If the uniform changes slightly—if, for 
example, a green stripe is added to the white pants while everything else 
remains the same—the immune system will continue to recognize the 
virus with little difﬁculty. But if the uniform goes from green shirt and 
white pants to white shirt with green pants, the immune system may not 
recognize the virus so easily. 
Antigen drift can create epidemics. One study found nineteen dis-
crete, identiﬁable epidemics in the United States in a thirty-three-year 
period—more than one every other year. Each one caused between ten 
thousand and forty thousand “excess deaths” in the United States alone— 
an excess over and above the death toll usually caused by the disease. As a 
result inﬂuenza kills more people in the United States than any other 
infectious disease, including AIDS. 
Public health experts monitor this drift and each year adjust the ﬂu 
vaccine to try to keep pace. But they will never be able to match up per-
"
"111 
The Swarm 
fectly, because even if they predict the direction of mutation, the fact that 
inﬂuenza viruses exist as mutating swarms means some will always be 
different enough to evade both the vaccine and the immune system. 
But as serious as antigen drift can be, as lethal an inﬂuenza as that 
phenomenon can create, it does not cause great pandemics. It does not 
create ﬁrestorms of inﬂuenza that spread worldwide such as those in 
1889–90, in 1918–19, in 1957, and in 1968. 
Pandemics generally develop only when a radical change in the hemag-
glutinin, or the neuraminidase, or both, occurs. When an entirely new 
gene coding for one or both replaces the old one, the shape of the new 
antigen bears little resemblance to the old one. 
This is called “antigen shift.” 
To use the football-uniform analogy again, antigen shift is the equiv-
alent of the virus changing from a green shirt and white pants to an 
orange shirt and black pants. 
When antigen shift occurs, the immune system cannot recognize the 
antigen at all. Few people in the world will have antibodies that can pro-
tect them against this new virus, so the virus can spread through a popu-
lation at an explosive rate. 
Hemagglutinin occurs in ﬁfteen known basic shapes, neuraminidase 
in nine, and they occur in different combinations with subtypes. Virologists 
use these antigens to identify what particular virus they are discussing or 
investigating. “H1N1,” for example, is the name given the 1918 virus, cur-
rently found in swine. An “H3N2” virus is circulating among people today. 
Antigen shift occurs when a virus that normally infects birds attacks 
humans directly or indirectly. In Hong Kong in 1997 an inﬂuenza virus 
identiﬁed as “H5N1” spread directly from chickens to people, infecting 
eighteen and killing six. 
Birds and humans have different sialic-acid receptors, so a virus that 
binds to a bird’s sialic-acid receptor will not normally bind to—and thus 
infect—a human cell. In Hong Kong what most likely happened was that 
the eighteen people who got sick were subjected to massive exposure to 
the virus. The swarm of these viruses, the quasi species, likely contained 
a mutation that could bind to human receptors, and the massive expo-
sure allowed that mutation to gain a foothold in the victims. Yet the virus 
"
"112 
The Great Influenza 
did not adapt itself to humans; all those who got sick were infected 
directly from chickens. 
But the virus can adapt to man. It can do so directly, with an entire ani-
mal virus jumping to humans and adapting with a simple mutation. It can 
also happen indirectly. For one ﬁnal and unusual attribute of the inﬂuenza 
virus makes it particularly adept at moving from species to species. 
The inﬂuenza virus not only mutates rapidly, but it also has a “seg-
mented” genome. This means that its genes do not lie along a continuous 
strand of its nucleic acid, as do genes in most organisms, including most 
other viruses. Instead, inﬂuenza genes are carried in unconnected strands 
of RNA. Therefore, if two different inﬂuenza viruses infect the same cell, 
“reassortment” of their genes becomes very possible. 
Reassortment mixes some of the segments of the genes of one virus 
with some from the other. It is like shufﬂing two different decks of cards 
together, then making up a new deck with cards from each one. This cre-
ates an entirely new hybrid virus, which increases the chances of a virus 
jumping from one species to another. 
If the Hong Kong chicken inﬂuenza had infected someone who was 
simultaneously infected with a human inﬂuenza virus, the two viruses 
might easily have reassorted their genes. They might have formed a new 
virus that could pass easily from person to person. And the lethal virus 
might have adapted to humans. 
The virus may also adapt indirectly, through an intermediary. Some 
virologists theorize that pigs provide a perfect “mixing bowl,” because 
the sialic-acid receptors on their cells can bind to both bird and human 
viruses. Whenever an avian virus infects swine at the same time that a 
human virus does, reassortment of the two viruses can occur. And an 
entirely new virus can emerge that can infect man. In 1918 veterinarians 
noted outbreaks of inﬂuenza in pigs and other mammals, and pigs today 
still get inﬂuenza from a direct descendant of the 1918 virus. But it is 
not clear whether pigs caught the disease from man or man caught it 
from pigs. 
And Dr. Peter Palese at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, one 
of the world’s leading experts on inﬂuenza viruses, considers the mixing-
bowl theory unnecessary to explain antigen shift: “It’s equally likely that 
co-infection of avian and human virus in a human in one cell in the lung 
[gives] rise to the virus. . . . There’s no reason why mixing couldn’t occur 
"
"The Swarm 
113 
in the lung, whether in pig or man. It’s not absolute that there are no 
sialic acid receptors of those types in other species. It’s not absolute 
that the avian receptor is really that different from the human, and, with 
one single amino acid change, the virus can go much better in another 
host.”* 
Antigen shift, this radical departure from existing antigens, led to 
major pandemics long before modern transportation allowed rapid 
movement of people. There is mixed opinion as to whether several pan-
demics in the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries were inﬂuenza although 
most medical historians believe that they were, largely because of the 
speed of their movement and the number of people who fell ill. In 1510 a 
pandemic of pulmonary disease came from Africa and “attacked at once 
and raged all over Europe not missing a family and scarce a person.” In 
1580 another pandemic started in Asia, then spread to Africa, Europe, 
and America. It was so ﬁerce “that in the space of six weeks it afﬂicted 
almost all the nations of Europe, of whom hardly the twentieth person 
was free of the disease,” and some Spanish cities were “nearly entirely 
depopulated by the disease.” 
There is no dispute, though, that other pandemics in the past were 
inﬂuenza. In 1688, the year of the Glorious Revolution, inﬂuenza struck 
England, Ireland, and Virginia. In these places “the people dyed . . . as in 
a plague.” Five years later, inﬂuenza spread again across Europe: “all con-
ditions of persons were attacked. . . .  [T]hose who were very strong and 
hardy were taken in the same manner as the weak and spoiled, . . . the  
youngest as well as the oldest.” In January 1699 in Massachusetts, Cotton 
Mather wrote, “The sickness extended to allmost all families. Few or none 
escaped, and many dyed especially in Boston, and some dyed in a strange 
or unusual manner, in some families all weer sick together, in some towns 
allmost all weer sick so that it was a time of disease.” 
At least three and possibly six pandemics struck Europe in the eigh-
teenth century, and at least four struck in the nineteenth century. In 1847 
*In 2001 Australian scientist Mark Gibbs advanced a theory that the inﬂuenza 
virus can also “recombine” its genes. Recombination means taking part of one gene 
and combining it with part of another gene. It is like cutting all the cards of two decks 
in pieces, taping the pieces together randomly, then assembling the ﬁrst ﬁfty-two for 
a new deck. Recombination has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but most virol-
ogists are skeptical of Gibbs’s hypothesis.

The Great Influenza 
and 1848 in London, more people died from inﬂuenza than died of 
cholera during the great cholera epidemic of 1832. And in 1889 and 1890, 
a great and violent worldwide pandemic—although nothing that even 
approached 1918 in violence—struck again. In the twentieth century, 
three pandemics struck. Each was caused by an antigen shift, by radical 
changes in either the hemagglutinin or the neuraminidase antigens, or 
both, or by changes in some other gene or genes. 
Inﬂuenza pandemics generally infect from 15 to 40 percent of a pop-
ulation; any inﬂuenza virus infecting that many people and killing a sig-
niﬁcant percentage would be beyond a nightmare. In recent years public 
health authorities have at least twice identiﬁed a new virus infecting 
humans but successfully prevented it from adapting to man. To prevent 
the 1997 Hong Kong virus, which killed six of eighteen people infected, 
from adapting to people, public health authorities had every single chicken 
then in Hong Kong, 1.2 million of them, slaughtered. (The action did not 
wipe out this H5N1 virus. It survives in chickens and in 2003 it infected 
two more people, killing one. A vaccine for this particular virus has been 
developed, although it has not been stockpiled.) 
An even greater slaughter of animals occurred in the spring of 2003 
when a new H7N7 virus appeared in poultry farms in the Netherlands, 
Belgium, and Germany. This virus infected eighty-three people and 
killed one, and it also infected pigs. So public health authorities killed 
nearly thirty million poultry and some swine. 
This costly and dreadful slaughter was done to prevent what hap-
pened in 1918. It was done to stop either of these inﬂuenza viruses from 
adapting to, and killing, man. 
One more thing makes inﬂuenza unusual. When a new inﬂuenza virus 
emerges, it is highly competitive, even cannibalistic. It usually drives 
older types into extinction. This happens because infection stimulates 
the body’s immune system to generate all its defenses against all inﬂuenza 
viruses to which the body has ever been exposed. When older viruses 
attempt to infect someone, they cannot gain a foothold. They cease repli-
cating. They die out. So, unlike practically every other known virus, only 
one type—one swarm or quasi species—of inﬂuenza virus dominates at 
any given time. This itself helps prepare the way for a new pandemic, 
"
"The Swarm 
115 
since the more time passes the fewer people’s immune systems will rec-
ognize other antigens. 
Not all pandemics are lethal. Antigen shift guarantees that the new 
virus will infect huge numbers of people, but it does not guarantee that it 
will kill large numbers. The twentieth century saw three pandemics. 
The most recent new virus attacked in 1968, when the H3N2 
“Hong Kong ﬂu” spread worldwide with high morbidity but very low 
mortality—that is, it made many sick, but killed few. The “Asian ﬂu,” an 
H2N2 virus, came in 1957; while nothing like 1918, this was still a violent 
pandemic. Then of course there was the H1N1 virus of 1918, the virus 
that created its own killing ﬁelds.

n the spring of 1918 death was no stranger to the world. Indeed, by 
then the bodies of more than ﬁve million soldiers had already been fed 
into what was called “the sausage factory” by generals whose stupidity 
was matched only by their brutality. 
German generals, for example, had decided to bleed France into sub-
mission by matching it death for death at Verdun, believing that Ger-
many’s greater population would leave it victorious. The French later 
replied with their own massive offensive, believing that their élan vital 
would triumph. 
Only slaughter triumphed. Finally one French regiment refused 
orders to make a suicidal charge. The mutiny spread to ﬁfty-four divi-
sions, stopped only by mass arrests, the conviction of twenty-three thou-
sand men for mutiny, with four hundred sentenced to death and ﬁfty-ﬁve 
actually executed. 
Yet nothing expressed the brutality of this war as did a sanitation 
report on the planned eradication of rats in the trenches to prevent the 
spread of disease. A major noted, “Certain unexpected problems are 
involved in the rat problem. . . .  The rat serves one useful function—he 
consumes the corpses on No Man’s Land, a job which the rat alone is will-
ing to undertake. For this reason it has been found desirable to control 
rather than eliminate the rat population.” 
All of Europe was weary of the war. Only in the United States

The Great Influenza 
Anglophiles and Francophiles, most of them concentrated on the East 
Coast and many of them holding positions of power or inﬂuence, were 
not weary. Only in the United States Anglophiles and Francophiles still 
regarded war as glorious. And they put intense pressure on President 
Woodrow Wilson to enter the war. 
The war had begun in 1914. Wilson had withstood this pressure. A 
German submarine had sunk the Lusitania in 1915 and he had not gone 
to war despite outrage in the press, instead winning a German commit-
ment to limit submarine warfare. He had resisted other justiﬁcations for 
war. He could fairly campaign for reelection in 1916 on the slogan “He 
Kept Us Out of War.” And he warned, “If you elect my opponent, you 
elect a war.” 
On election night he went to bed believing he had lost, but woke up 
reelected by one of the narrowest margins in history. 
Then Germany took a great gamble. On January 31, 1917, giving only 
twenty-four hours’ notice, it announced unrestricted submarine warfare 
against neutral and merchant vessels. It believed that it could starve 
Britain and France into submission before the United States—if the 
United States did at last declare war—could help. The action utterly out-
raged the nation. 
Still Wilson did not go to war. 
Then came the Zimmermann note: captured documents revealed 
that the German foreign minister had proposed to Mexico that it join 
Germany in war against the United States and reconquer parts of New 
Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. 
Wilson’s critics sputtered in fury at his pusillanimity. In a famous 
essay, paciﬁst and socialist Randolph Bourne, who later died in the 
inﬂuenza epidemic, lamented, “The war sentiment, begun so gradually 
but so perseveringly by the preparedness advocates who come from the 
ranks of big business, caught hold of one after another of the intellectual 
groups. With the aid of [Theodore] Roosevelt, the murmurs became a 
monotonous chant, and ﬁnally a chorus so mighty that to be out of it was 
at ﬁrst to be disreputable and ﬁnally almost obscene. And slowly a stri-
dent rant was worked up against Germany.” 
On April 2, three weeks after the disclosure of the note, after his cabi-
net unanimously called for war, Wilson ﬁnally delivered his war message 
"
"121 
The Tinderbox 
to Congress. Two days later he explained to a friend, “It was necessary for 
me by very slow stages and with the most genuine purpose to avoid war 
to lead the country on to a single way of thinking.” 
And so the United States entered the war ﬁlled with a sense of selﬂess 
mission, believing glory still possible, and still keeping itself separate from 
what it regarded as the corrupt Old World. It fought alongside Britain, 
France, Italy, and Russia not as an “ally” but as an “Associated Power.” 
Anyone who believed that Wilson’s reluctant embrace of war meant 
that he would not prosecute it aggressively knew nothing of him. He was 
one of those rare men who believed almost to the point of mental illness 
in his own righteousness. 
Wilson believed in fact that his will and spirit were informed by the 
spirit and hope of a people and even of God. He talked of his “sympa-
thetic connection which I am sure that I have with” all American citizens 
and said, “I am sure that my heart speaks the same thing that they wish 
their hearts to speak.” “I will not cry ‘peace’ so long as there is sin and 
wrong in the world,” he went on. “America was born to exemplify that 
devotion to the elements of righteousness which are derived from the 
revelations of Holy Scripture.” 
He is probably the only American president to have held to this belief 
with quite such conviction, with no sign of self-doubt. It is a trait more 
associated with crusaders than politicians. 
To Wilson this war was a crusade, and he intended to wage total war. 
Perhaps knowing himself even more than the country, he predicted, 
“Once lead this people into war, and they’ll forget there ever was such a 
thing as tolerance. To ﬁght you must be brutal and ruthless, and the spirit 
of ruthless brutality will enter into the very ﬁbre of our national life, 
infecting Congress, the courts, the policeman on the beat, the man in the 
street.” 
America had never been and would never be so informed by the will 
of its chief executive, not during the Civil War with the suspension of 
habeas corpus, not during Korea and the McCarthy period, not even dur-
ing World War II. He would turn the nation into a weapon, an explosive 
device. 
As an unintended consequence, the nation became a tinderbox for 
epidemic disease as well.

Wilson declared, “It isn’t an army we must shape and train for war, it is a 
nation.” 
To train the nation, Wilson used an iron ﬁst minus any velvet glove. 
He did have some legitimate reasons for concern, reasons to justify a hard 
line. 
For reasons entirely unrelated to the war, America was a rumbling 
chaos of change and movement, its very nature and identity shifting. In 
1870 the United States numbered only forty million souls, 72 percent of 
whom lived in small towns or on farms. By the time America entered the 
war, the population had increased to roughly 105 million. Between 1900 
and 1915 alone, ﬁfteen million immigrants ﬂooded the United States; 
most came from Eastern and Southern Europe, with new languages and 
religions, along with darker complexions. And the ﬁrst census after the 
war would also be the ﬁrst one to ﬁnd more people living in urban areas 
than rural. 
The single largest ethnic group in the United States was German-
American and a large German-language press had been sympathetic to 
Germany. Would German-Americans ﬁght against Germany? The Irish 
Republican Army had launched an uprising against British rule on 
Easter, 1916. Would Irish-Americans ﬁght to help Britain? The Midwest 
was isolationist. Would it send soldiers across an ocean when the United 
States had not been attacked? Populists opposed war, and Wilson’s own 
secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan, three times the Democratic 
nominee for president, had resigned from the cabinet in 1915 after 
Wilson responded too aggressively for him to Germany’s torpedoing 
the Lusitania. Socialists and radical unionists were strong in factories, 
in mining communities in the Rockies, in the Northwest. Would they, 
drafted or not, defend capitalism? 
The hard line was designed to intimidate those reluctant to support 
the war into doing so, and to crush or eliminate those who would not. 
Even before entering the war, Wilson had warned Congress, “There are 
citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, . . . who have poured the  
poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life. . . . Such  
creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out.” 
He intended to do so. 
"
"123 
The Tinderbox 
His ﬁre informed virtually everything that happened in the country, 
including fashion: to save cloth, a war material—everything was a war 
material—designers narrowed lapels and eliminated or shrank pockets. 
And his fury particularly informed every act of the United States govern-
ment. During the Civil War Lincoln had suspended the writ of habeas cor-
pus, imprisoning hundreds of people. But those imprisoned presented a real 
threat of armed rebellion. He left unchecked extraordinarily harsh criticism. 
Wilson believed he had not gone far enough and told his cousin, “Thank 
God for Abraham Lincoln. I won’t make the mistakes that he made.” 
The government compelled conformity, controlled speech in ways, 
frightening ways, not known in America before or since. Soon after the de-
claration of war, Wilson pushed the Espionage Act through a cooperative 
Congress, which balked only at legalizing outright press censorship— 
despite Wilson’s calling it “an imperative necessity.” 
The bill gave Postmaster General Albert Sidney Burleson the right 
to refuse to deliver any periodical he deemed unpatriotic or critical of 
the administration. And, before television and radio, most of the politi-
cal discourse in the country went through the mails. A southerner, a nar-
row man and a hater, nominally a populist but closer to the Pitchfork Ben 
Tillman wing of the party than to that of William Jennings Bryan, Burle-
son soon had the post ofﬁce stop delivery of virtually all publications and 
any foreign-language publication that hinted at less-than-enthusiastic 
support of the war. 
Attorney General Thomas Gregory called for still more power. Greg-
ory was a progressive largely responsible for Wilson’s nominating Louis 
Brandeis to the Supreme Court, a liberal and the court’s ﬁrst Jew. Now, 
observing that America was “a country governed by public opinion,” Greg-
ory intended to help Wilson rule opinion and, through opinion, the 
country. He demanded that the Librarian of Congress report the names 
of those who had asked for certain books and also explained that the gov-
ernment needed to monitor “the individual casual or impulsive disloyal 
utterances.” To do the latter, Gregory pushed for a law broad enough to 
punish statements made “from good motives or . . . [if] traitorous mo-
tives weren’t provable.” 
The administration got such a law. In 1798, Federalist President John 
Adams and his party, under pressure of undeclared war with France, passed 
"
"124 
The Great Influenza 
the Sedition Act, which made it unlawful to “print, utter, or publish . . .  
any false, scandalous, or malicious writing” against the government. But 
that law inﬂamed controversy, contributed to Adams’s reelection defeat, 
and led to the only impeachment of a Supreme Court justice in history, 
when Samuel Chase both helped get grand jury indictments of critics 
and then sentenced these same critics to maximum terms. 
Wilson’s administration went further, yet engendered little opposition. 
The new Sedition Act made it punishable by twenty years in jail to “utter, 
print, write or publish any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive lan-
guage about the government of the United States.” One could go to jail 
for cursing the government, or criticizing it, even if what one said was true. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the Supreme Court opinion that found the 
act constitutional—after the war ended, upholding lengthy prison terms 
for the defendants—arguing that the First Amendment did not protect 
speech if “the words used . . . create a clear and present danger.” 
To enforce that law, the head of what became the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation agreed to make a volunteer group called the American Pro-
tective League an adjunct to the Justice Department, and authorized them 
to carry badges identifying them as “Secret Service.” Within a few months 
the APL would have ninety thousand members. Within a year, two hundred 
thousand APL members were operating in a thousand communities. 
In Chicago a “ﬂying squad” of league members and police trailed, 
harassed, and beat members of the International Workers of the World. 
In Arizona, league members and vigilantes locked twelve hundred IWW 
members and their “collaborators” into boxcars and left them on a siding 
in the desert across the state line in New Mexico. In Rockford, Illinois, the 
army asked the league for help in gaining confessions from twenty-one 
black soldiers accused of assaulting white women. Throughout the coun-
try, the league’s American Vigilance Patrol targeted “seditious street ora-
tory,” sometimes calling upon the police to arrest speakers for disorderly 
conduct, sometimes acting more . . . directly. And everywhere the league 
spied on neighbors, investigated “slackers” and “food hoarders,” demanded 
to know why people didn’t buy—or didn’t buy more—Liberty Bonds. 
States outlawed the teaching of German, while an Iowa politician 
warned that “ninety percent of all the men and women who teach the 
German language are traitors.” Conversations in German on the street or 
over the telephone became suspicious. Sauerkraut was renamed “Liberty 
"
"125 
The Tinderbox 
cabbage.” The Cleveland Plain Dealer stated, “What the nation demands 
is that treason, whether thinly veiled or quite unmasked, be stamped 
out.” Every day the Providence Journal carried a banner warning, “Every 
German or Austrian in the United States unless known by years of asso-
ciation should be treated as a spy.” The Illinois Bar Association declared 
that lawyers who defended draft resisters were “unpatriotic” and “unpro-
fessional.” Columbia University president Nicholas Murray Butler, a 
national leader of the Republican Party, ﬁred faculty critical of the gov-
ernment and observed, “What had been tolerable became intolerable 
now. What had been wrongheadedness was now sedition. What had been 
folly was now treason.” 
Thousands of government posters and advertisements urged people 
to report to the Justice Department anyone “who spreads pessimistic sto-
ries, divulges—or seeks—conﬁdential military information, cries for peace, 
or belittles our effort to win the war.” Wilson himself began speaking of 
the “sinister intrigue” in America carried on “high and low” by “agents 
and dupes.” 
Even Wilson’s enemies, even the supposedly internationalist Commu-
nists, distrusted foreigners. Two Communist parties initially emerged in 
the United States, one with a membership of native-born Americans, one 
90 percent immigrants. 
Judge Learned Hand, one of Simon Flexner’s closest friends, later 
observed, “That community is already in the process of dissolution where 
each man begins to eye his neighbor as a possible enemy, where non-
conformity with the accepted creed, political as well as religious, becomes a 
mark of disaffection; where denunciation, without speciﬁcation or backing, 
takes the place of evidence; where orthodoxy chokes freedom of dissent.” 
But American society hardly seemed to be dissolving. In fact it was 
crystallizing around a single focal point; it was more intent upon a goal 
than it had ever been, or might possibly ever be again. 
Wilson’s hard line threatened dissenters with imprisonment. The federal 
government also took control over much of national life. The War Indus-
tries Board allocated raw materials to factories, guaranteed proﬁts, and 
controlled production and prices of war materials, and, with the National 
War Labor Board, it set wages as well. The Railroad Administration virtually 
nationalized the American railroad industry. The Fuel Administration 
"
"126 
The Great Influenza 
controlled fuel distribution (and to save fuel it also instituted daylight 
savings time). The Food Admininstration—under Herbert Hoover— 
oversaw agricultural production, pricing, and distribution. And the gov-
ernment inserted itself in the psyche of America by allowing only its own 
voice to be heard, by both threatening dissenters with prison and shout-
ing down everyone else. 
Prior to the war Major Douglas MacArthur had written a long proposal 
advocating outright censorship if the nation did ﬁght. Journalist Arthur 
Bullard, who was close to Wilson conﬁdant Colonel Edward House, argued 
for another approach. Congress’s rejection of censorship settled the argu-
ment in Bullard’s favor. 
Bullard had written from Europe about the war for Outlook, Century, 
and Harper’s Weekly. He pointed out that Britain was censoring the press 
and had misled the British people, undermining trust in the government 
and support for the war. He urged using facts only. But he had no partic-
ular affection for truth per se, only for effectiveness: “Truth and falsehood 
are arbitrary  terms. . . . There is  nothing in experience to tell us that one 
is always preferable to the other. . . . There are lifeless truths and vital 
lies. . . .  The force of an idea lies in its inspirational value. It matters very 
little if it is true or false.” 
Then, probably at the request of House, Walter Lippmann wrote Wil-
son a memo on creating a publicity bureau on April 12, 1917, a week after 
America declared war. One outgrowth of the Progressive Era, of the emer-
gence of experts in many ﬁelds, was the conviction that an elite knew 
best. Typically, Lippmann later called society “too big, too complex” for 
the average person to comprehend, since most citizens were “mentally 
children or barbarians. . . . Self-determination [is] only one of the many 
interests of a human personality.” Lippmann urged that self-rule be sub-
ordinated to “order,” “rights,” and “prosperity.” 
The day after receiving the memo, Wilson issued Executive Order 
2594, creating the Committee on Public Information—the CPI—and 
named George Creel its head. 
Creel was passionate, intense, handsome, and wild. (Once, years after 
the war and well into middle age, he literally climbed onto a chandelier in 
a ballroom and swung from it.) He intended to create “one white-hot 
mass . . . with fraternity, devotion, courage, and deathless determination.” 
"
"127 
The Tinderbox 
To do so, Creel used tens of thousands of press releases and feature 
stories that were routinely run unedited by newspapers. And those same 
publications instituted a self-censorship. Editors would print nothing that 
they thought might hurt morale. Creel also created a force of “Four Minute 
Men”—their number ultimately exceeded one hundred thousand—who 
gave brief speeches before the start of meetings, movies, vaudeville shows, 
and entertainment of all kinds. Bourne sadly observed, “[A]ll this intel-
lectual cohesion—herd-instinct—which seemed abroad so hysterical 
and so servile comes to us here in highly rational terms.” 
Creel began intending to report only facts, if carefully selected ones, 
and conducting only a positive campaign, avoiding the use of fear as a 
tool. But this soon changed. The new attitude was embodied in a decla-
ration by one of Creel’s writers that, “Inscribed in our banner even above 
the legend Truth is the noblest of all mottoes—‘We Serve.’” They served 
a cause. One poster designed to sell Liberty Bonds warned, “I am Public 
Opinion. All men fear me! . . .  [I]f you have the money to buy and do not 
buy, I will make this No Man’s Land for you!” Another CPI poster asked, 
“Have you met this Kaiserite? . . . You  ﬁnd him in hotel lobbies, smoking 
compartments, clubs, ofﬁces, even homes. . . . He is a  scandal-monger of 
the most dangerous type. He repeats all the rumors, criticism, and lies he 
hears about our country’s part in the war. He’s very plausible. . . . People  
like  that . . . through  their vanity or curiosity or treason they are helping 
German propagandists sow the seeds of discontent. . . .” 
Creel demanded “100% Americanism” and planned for “every 
printed bullet [to] reach its mark.” Simultaneously, he told the Four 
Minute Men that fear was “an important element to be bred in the civil-
ian population. It is difﬁcult to unite a people by talking only on the 
highest ethical plane. To ﬁght for an ideal, perhaps, must be coupled with 
thoughts of self-preservation.” 
“Liberty Sings”—weekly community events—spread from Philadel-
phia across the country. Children’s choruses, barbershop quartets, church 
choirs—all performed patriotic songs while the audiences sang along. At 
each gathering a Four Minute Man began the ceremonies with a speech. 
Songs that might hurt morale were prohibited. Raymond Fosdick, a 
student of Wilson’s at Princeton and board member (and later president) 
of the Rockefeller Foundation, headed the Commission on Training Camp 
"
"128 
The Great Influenza 
Activities. This commission banned such songs as “I Wonder Who’s Kiss-
ing Her Now” and “venomous parodies” such as “Who Paid the Rent for 
Mrs. Rip Van Winkle While Mr. Rip Van Winkle Was Away?” along with 
“questionable jokes and other jokes, which while apparently harmless, 
have a hidden sting—which leave the poison of discontent and worry 
and anxiety in the minds of the soldiers and cause them to fret about 
home. . . .  [T]he songs and jokes were the culmination of letter writing 
propaganda instigated by the Huns in which they told lying tales to the 
men of alleged conditions of suffering at home.” 
And Wilson gave no quarter. To open a Liberty Loan drive, Wilson 
demanded, “Force! Force to the utmost! Force without stint or limit! the 
righteous and triumphant Force which shall make Right the law of the 
world, and cast every selﬁsh dominion down in the dust.” 
That force would ultimately, if indirectly, intensify the attack of inﬂuenza 
and undermine the social fabric. A softer path that Wilson also tried to lead 
the nation down would mitigate—but only somewhat—the damage. 
The softer path meant the American Red Cross. 
If the American Protective League mobilized citizens, nearly all of 
them men, to spy upon and attack anyone who criticized the war, the 
American Red Cross mobilized citizens, nearly all of them women, in 
more productive ways. The International Red Cross had been founded in 
1863 with its focus on war, on the decent treatment of prisoners as set 
forth in the ﬁrst Geneva Convention. In 1881 Clara Barton founded the 
American Red Cross, and the next year the United States accepted the 
guidelines of the convention. By World War I, all the combatants were 
members of the International Red Cross. But each national unit was fully 
independent. 
The American Red Cross was a quasi-public institution whose titular 
president was (and is) the president of the United States. Ofﬁcially char-
tered by Congress to serve the nation in times of emergency, the Ameri-
can Red Cross grew even closer to the government during the war. The 
chairman of its Central Committee was Wilson’s presidential predecessor 
William Howard Taft, and Wilson had appointed its entire “War Coun-
cil,” the real ruling body of the organization. 
As soon as the United States entered World War I, the American Red 
"
"129 
The Tinderbox 
Cross declared that it would “exert itself in any way which . . . might aid 
our allies. . . .  The organization seeks in this great world emergency to do 
nothing more and nothing less than to coordinate the generosity and the 
effort of our people toward achieving a supreme aim.” 
There was no more patriotic organization. It had full responsibility 
for supplying nurses, tens of thousands of them, to the military. It orga-
nized ﬁfty base hospitals in France. It equipped several railroad cars as 
specialized laboratories in case of disease outbreaks—but reserving them 
for use only by the military, not by civilians—and stationed them “so that 
one may be delivered at any point [in the country] within 24 hours.” 
(The Rockefeller Institute also outﬁtted railroad cars as state-of-the-art 
laboratories and placed them around the country.) It cared for civilians 
injured or made homeless after several explosions in munitions factories. 
But its most important role had nothing to do with medicine or dis-
asters. Its most important function was to bind the nation together, for 
Wilson used it to reach into every community in the country. Nor did the 
Red Cross waste the opportunity to increase its presence in American life. 
It had already made a reputation in several disasters: the Johnstown 
ﬂood in 1889, when a dam broke and water smashed down upon the 
Pennsylvania city like a hammer, killing twenty-ﬁve hundred people; the 
San Francisco earthquake in 1906; major ﬂoods on the Ohio and Missis-
sippi Rivers in 1912. It had also served American troops in the Spanish-
American War and during the insurrection in the Philippines that followed. 
Still, the American Red Cross began the Great War with only 107 local 
chapters. It ﬁnished with 3,864 chapters. 
It reached into the largest cities and into the smallest villages. It made 
clear that to participate in Red Cross activities was to join the great cru-
sade for civilization, and especially for American civilization. And it used 
subtlety and social pressure to all but compel participation. It identiﬁed 
the most prominent and inﬂuential man in a city, a person whom others 
could refuse only with difﬁculty, and asked him to chair the local Red 
Cross chapter; it appealed to him, told him how important he was to 
the war effort, how needed he was. Almost invariably he agreed. And it 
asked the leading hostess, the leader of “society” in cities—in Philadelphia, 
Mrs. J. Willis Martin, who started the nation’s ﬁrst garden club and whose 
family and husband’s family were as established as any on the Main 
"
"130 
The Great Influenza 
Line—or whatever passed for “society” in small towns—in Haskell County, 
Mrs. Loring Miner, whose father was the largest landowner in southwest 
Kansas—to chair a woman’s auxiliary. 
In 1918 the Red Cross counted thirty million Americans—out of a 
total population of 105 million—as active supporters. Eight million Amer-
icans, nearly 8 percent of the entire population, served as production 
workers in local chapters. (The Red Cross had more volunteers in World 
War I than in World War II despite a 30 percent increase in the nation’s 
population.) Women made up nearly all this enormous volunteer work-
force, and they might as well have worked in factories. Each chapter 
received a production quota, and each chapter produced that quota. They 
produced millions of sweaters, millions of blankets, millions of socks. 
They made furniture. They did everything requested of them, and they 
did it well. When the Federal Food Administration said that pits from 
peaches, prunes, dates, plums, apricots, olives, and cherries were needed 
to make carbon for gas masks, newspapers reported, “Confectioners and 
restaurants in various cities have begun to serve nuts and fruit at cost in 
order to turn in the pits and shells, a patriotic service. . . . Every Ameri-
can man, woman or child who has a relative or friend in the army should 
consider it a matter of personal obligation to provide enough carbon 
making material for his gas mask.” And so Red Cross chapters through-
out the country collected thousands of tons of fruit pits—so many they 
were told, ﬁnally, to stop. 
As William Maxwell, a novelist and New Yorker editor who grew up in 
Lincoln, Illinois, recalled, “[M]other would go down to roll bandages for 
the soldiers. She put something like a dish towel on her head with a red 
cross on the front and wore white, and in school we saved prune pits 
which were supposed to be turned into gas masks so that the town was 
aware of the war effort. . . . At all events there was an active sense of tak-
ing part in the war.” 
The war was absorbing all of the nation. The draft, originally limited to 
men aged twenty-one to thirty, was soon extended to men aged eighteen 
to forty-ﬁve. Even with the expanded base, the government declared that 
all men in that age group would be called within a year. All men, the gov-
ernment said. 
The army would require as well at least one hundred thousand ofﬁ-
"
"131 
The Tinderbox 
cers. The Student Army Training Corps was to provide many of that num-
ber: it would admit “men by voluntary induction, . . . placing them on 
active duty immediately.” 
In May 1918 Secretary of War Newton Baker wrote the presidents of 
all institutions “of Collegiate Grade,” from Harvard in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts, to the North Paciﬁc College of Dentistry in Portland, Oregon. 
He did not ask for cooperation, much less permission. He simply stated, 
“Military instruction under ofﬁcers and non-commissioned ofﬁcers of 
the Army will be provided in every institution of college grade which 
enroll 100 or more male students. . . . All  students over the age of 18 will 
be encouraged to enlist. . . .  The commanding ofﬁcer . . . [will] enforce  
military discipline.” 
In August 1918 an underling followed Baker’s letter with a memo to 
college administrators, stating that the war would likely necessitate “the 
mobilization of all physically-ﬁt registrants under 21, within 10 months 
from this date. . . .  The student, by voluntary induction, becomes a sol-
dier in the United States Army, uniformed, subject to military discipline 
and with the pay of a private . . . on full active duty.”  Upon being acti-
vated, nearly all would be sent to the front. Twenty-year-olds would get 
only three months’ training before activation, with younger men getting 
only a few months more. “In view of the comparatively short time during 
which most of the student-soldiers will remain in college and the exact-
ing military duties awaiting them, academic instruction must necessarily 
be modiﬁed along the lines of direct military value.” 
Therefore the teaching of academic courses was to end, to be replaced 
by military training. Military ofﬁcers were to take virtual command of 
each college in the country. High schools were “urged to intensify their 
instruction so that young men 17 and 18 years old may be qualiﬁed to 
enter college as quickly as possible.” 
The full engagement of the nation had begun the instant Wilson had 
chosen war. Initially the American Expeditionary Force in Europe was 
just that, a small force numbering little more than a skirmish line. But the 
American army was massing. And the forging of all the nation into a 
weapon was approaching completion. 
That process would jam millions of young men into extraordinarily 
tight quarters in barracks built for far fewer. It would bring millions of 
"
"132

workers into factories and cities where there was no housing, where men 
and women not only shared rooms but beds, where they not only shared 
beds but shared beds in shifts, where one shift of workers came home— 
if their room could be called a home—and climbed into a bed just 
vacated by others leaving to go to work, where they breathed the same air, 
drank from the same cups, used the same knives and forks. 
That process also meant that through both intimidation and volun-
tary cooperation, despite a stated disregard for truth, the government 
controlled the ﬂow of information. 
The full engagement of the nation would thus provide the great 
sausage machine with more than one way to grind a body up. It would 
grind away with the icy neutrality that technology and nature share, and 
it would not limit itself to the usual cannon fodder. 
"
"C H A P T E R  T E N

hile America still remained neutral William Welch, then presi-
dent of the National Academy of Sciences, and his colleagues 
watched as their European counterparts tried to perfect killing devices. 
Technology has always mattered in war, but this was the ﬁrst truly sci-
entiﬁc war, the ﬁrst war that matched engineers and their abilities to 
build not just artillery but submarines and airplanes and tanks, the ﬁrst 
war that matched laboratories of chemists and physiologists devising or 
trying to counteract the most lethal poison gas. Technology, like nature, 
always exhibits the ice of neutrality however heated its effect. Some even 
saw the war itself as a magniﬁcent laboratory in which to test and im-
prove not just the hard sciences but theories of crowd behavior, of scien-
tiﬁc management of the means of production, of what was thought of as 
the new science of public relations. 
The National Academy had itself been created during the Civil War to 
advise the government on science, but it did not direct or coordinate sci-
entiﬁc research on war technologies. No American institution did. In 1915 
astronomer George Hale began urging Welch and others in the NAS to 
take the lead in creating such an institution. He convinced them, and in 
April 1916 Welch wrote Wilson, “The Academy now considers it to be its 
plain duty, in case of war or preparation for war, to volunteer its assistance 
and secure the enlistment of its members for any services we can offer.” 
Wilson had been a graduate student at the Hopkins when Welch had 
"
"134 
The Great Influenza 
ﬁrst arrived there and immediately invited him, Hale, and a few others to 
the White House. There they proposed to establish a National Research 
Council to direct all war-related scientiﬁc work. But they needed the 
president to formally request its creation. Wilson immediately agreed 
although he insisted the move remain conﬁdential. 
He wanted conﬁdentiality because any preparation for war set off 
debate, and Wilson was about to use all the political capital he cared to in 
order to create the Council of National Defense, which was to lay plans 
for what would become, after the country entered the war, the virtual 
government takeover of the production and distribution of economic 
resources. The council’s membership was comprised of six cabinet secre-
taries, including the secretaries of war and the navy, and seven men out-
side the government. (Ironically, considering Wilson’s intense Christianity, 
three of the seven were Jews: Samuel Gompers, head of the American 
Federation of Labor; Bernard Baruch, the ﬁnancier; and Julius Rosen-
wald, head of Sears. Almost simultaneously, Wilson appointed Brandeis 
to the Supreme Court. All this marked the ﬁrst signiﬁcant representation 
of Jews in government.) 
But Wilson’s silent approval was enough. Welch, Hale, and the others 
formed their new organization, bringing in respected scientists in several 
ﬁelds, scientists who asked other colleagues to conduct speciﬁc pieces of 
research, research that ﬁtted in with other pieces, research that together had 
potential applications. And medicine, too, had become a weapon of war. 
By then a kind of organizational chart had developed in American scien-
tiﬁc medicine. This chart of course did not exist in any formal sense, but 
it was real. 
At the top sat Welch, fully the impresario, capable of changing the 
lives of those upon whom his glance lingered, capable as well of directing 
great sums of money to an institution with a nod. Only he held such 
power in American science, and no one else has held such power since. 
On the rung below him were a handful of contemporaries, men who 
had fought beside him to change medicine in the United States and who 
had well-deserved reputations. Perhaps Victor Vaughan ranked second to 
him as a builder of institutions; he had created a solid one at Michigan 
and been the single most important voice outside the Hopkins demand-

ing reform of medical education. In surgery the brothers Charles and 
William Mayo were giants and immensely important allies in forcing 
change. In the laboratory Theobald Smith inspired. In public health Her-
mann Biggs had made the New York City Department of Health proba-
bly the best municipal health department in the world, and he had just 
taken over the state health department, while in Providence, Rhode 
Island, Charles Chapin had applied the most rigorous science to public 
health questions and reached conclusions that were revolutionizing pub-
lic health practices. And in the U.S. Army, Surgeon General William Gor-
gas also had developed an international reputation, continuing and 
expanding upon George Sternberg’s tradition. 
Both the National Research Council and the Council of National 
Defense had medical committees that were controlled by Welch himself, 
Gorgas, Vaughan, and the Mayo brothers, all ﬁve of whom had already 
served as president of the American Medical Association. But conspicu-
ous by his absence was Rupert Blue, then the civilian surgeon general and 
head of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS). Welch and his col-
leagues so doubted his abilities and judgment that they not only blocked 
him from serving on the committees but would not allow him even to 
name his own representative to them. Instead they picked a USPHS sci-
entist they trusted. It was not a good sign that the head of the public 
health service was so little regarded. 
From the beginning of their planning, these men focused on the 
biggest killer in war—not combat, but epidemic disease. Throughout the 
wars in history more soldiers had often died of disease than in battle or 
of their wounds. And epidemic disease had routinely spread from armies 
to civilian populations. 
This was true not just in ancient times or in the American Civil War, 
in which two men died from disease for every battle-related death 
(counting both sides, one hundred eighty-ﬁve thousand troops died in 
combat or of their wounds, while three hundred seventy-three thousand 
died of disease). More soldiers had died of disease than combat even in 
the wars fought since scientists had adopted the germ theory and mod-
ern public health measures. In the Boer War that raged from 1899 to 1902 
between Britain and the white settlers of South Africa, ten British troops 
died of disease for each combat-related death. (The British also put 
"
"136 
The Great Influenza 
nearly a quarter of the Boer population in concentration camps, where 
26,370 women and children died.) In the Spanish-American War in 1898, 
six American soldiers died of disease—nearly all of them from typhoid— 
for every one killed in battle or who died of his wounds. 
The Spanish-American War deaths especially were entirely unneces-
sary. The army had expanded in a matter of months from twenty-eight 
thousand to two hundred seventy-ﬁve thousand, and Congress had 
appropriated $50 million for the military, but not a penny went to the 
army medical department; as a result, a camp of sixty thousand soldiers 
at Chickamauga had not a single microscope. Nor was army surgeon gen-
eral Sternberg given any authority. Military engineers and line ofﬁcers 
directly rejected his angry protests about a dangerously unsanitary camp 
design and water supply. Their stubbornness killed roughly ﬁve thousand 
American young men. 
Other diseases could be equally dangerous. When even normally mild 
diseases such as whooping cough, chickenpox, and mumps invade a “vir-
gin” human population, a population not previously exposed to them, 
they often kill in large numbers—and young adults are especially vulner-
able. In the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, for example, measles killed 40 
percent of those who fell ill during the siege of Paris, and a measles epi-
demic erupted in the U.S. Army in 1911, killing 5 percent of all the men 
who caught the disease. 
Those facts were of deep concern to Welch, Vaughan, Gorgas, and the 
others. They committed themselves to ensuring that the best medical sci-
ence be available to the military. Welch, sixty-seven years old, short, 
obese, and out of breath, put a uniform on, devoted much time to army 
business, and took a desk in Gorgas’s personal ofﬁce that he used when-
ever in Washington. Vaughan, sixty-ﬁve years old and equally obese at 
275 pounds, put a uniform on and became head of the army’s Division of 
Communicable Disease. Flexner at age ﬁfty-four put a uniform on. Gor-
gas had them all commissioned majors, the highest rank then allowed 
(regulations were changed and they all later became colonels). 
They thought not only about caring for soldiers wounded in combat. 
They thought not only about ﬁnding a source for digitalis, which was 
imported from Germany (Boy Scouts gathered foxglove in Oregon and 
tests found it produced a suitable drug), or surgical needles (these too 
were all imported, so they set up a U.S. factory to produce them), or 
"
"137 
The Tinderbox 
discovering the most efﬁcient way to disinfect huge amounts of laundry 
(they asked Chapin to look into this). 
They thought about epidemic disease. 
The single man who had the chief responsibility for the performance of 
military medicine was Surgeon General of the Army William Crawford 
Gorgas. The army gave him little authority with which to work—not 
much more than Sternberg had had. But he was a man able to accomplish 
much in the face of not only benign neglect but outright opposition from 
those above him. 
Naturally optimistic and cheerful, devout, son of a Confederate ofﬁ-
cer who became president of the University of Alabama, Gorgas took up 
medicine ironically in pursuit of another aim: a military career. After he 
failed to get an appointment to West Point, it seemed his only way into 
the army, and he took it despite his father’s bitter opposition. He soon 
became entirely comfortable in medicine and preferred to be addressed 
as “Doctor” rather than by rank, even as he rose to “General.” He loved 
learning and set aside a ﬁxed amount of minutes each day for reading, 
rotating his attention among ﬁction, science, and classical literature. 
Gorgas had a distinct softness around his eyes that made him appear 
gentle, and he treated virtually everyone with whom he came into contact 
with dignity. His appearance and manner belied, however, his intensity, 
determination, focus, and occasional ferocity. In the midst of crisis or 
obstacles his public equanimity made him a center of calm, the kind that 
calmed and gave conﬁdence to others. But in private, after encountering 
obtuseness if not outright stupidity in his superiors, he slammed drawers, 
hurled inkwells, and stormed out of his ofﬁce muttering threats to quit. 
Like Sternberg, he spent much of his early career at frontier posts in 
the West, although he also took Welch’s course at Bellevue. Unlike Stern-
berg, he did not personally do any signiﬁcant laboratory research. But he 
was every bit as tenacious, every bit as disciplined. 
Two experiences epitomized both his abilities and his determination 
to do his job. The ﬁrst came in Havana after the Spanish-American War. 
He did not belong to Walter Reed’s team investigating yellow fever. Their 
work in fact did not convince him that the mosquito carried the disease. 
Nonetheless he was given the task of killing mosquitoes in Havana. He 
succeeded in this task—despite doubting its usefulness—so well that in 
"
"138 
The Great Influenza 
1902 yellow fever deaths there fell to zero. Zero. And malaria deaths fell by 
75 percent. (The results convinced him that the mosquito hypothesis was 
correct.) An even more signiﬁcant triumph came when he later took 
charge of clearing yellow fever from the construction sites along the 
Panama Canal. In this case his superiors rejected the mosquito hypothe-
sis, gave him the barest minimum of resources, and tried to undermine 
his authority, his effort, and him personally, at one point demanding that 
he be replaced. He persisted—and succeeded—partly through his intelli-
gence and insight into the problems disease presented, partly through his 
ability to maneuver bureaucratically. In the process he also earned a rep-
utation as an international expert on public health and sanitation. 
He became surgeon general of the army in 1914 and immediately 
began massaging congressmen and senators for money and authority to 
prepare in case the country went to war. He wanted no repeat of Stern-
berg’s Spanish-American experience. Believing his work done, in 1917 he 
submitted his resignation to join a Rockefeller-sponsored international 
health project. When the United States entered the war, he withdrew his 
resignation. 
Then sixty-three years old, white-haired, with a handlebar mustache, 
and thin—as a boy he had been almost fragile, and he remained thin 
despite an appetite for food that rivaled Welch’s—he took as his ﬁrst task 
surrounding himself with the best possible people, while simultaenously 
trying to inject his and their inﬂuence into army planning. His War 
Department seniors did not consult his department on the sites for its 
several dozen new cantonments, but army engineers did pay close atten-
tion to the medical department in the actual design of the training 
camps. They too wanted no repeat of the mistakes that had killed thou-
sands of soldiers in 1898. 
But only in one other area did the army medical department receive 
even a hearing from War Department leadership. That was its massive 
campaign against venereal disease, a campaign supported strongly by a 
political union of progressives, many of whom believed in perfecting sec-
ular society, and from Christian moralists. (The same political odd cou-
ple would soon unite to enact Prohibition.) Gorgas’s ofﬁce recognized “to 
what extremes the sexual moralist can go. How unpractical, how intoler-
ant, how extravagant, even how unreasoning, if not scientiﬁcally dishon-
est, he can be.” But it also knew that one-third of all workdays lost to 
"
"139 
The Tinderbox 
illness in the army were caused by venereal disease. That loss the military 
would not tolerate. 
The medical corps told enlisted men to masturbate instead of using 
prostitutes. It produced posters with such slogans as, “A Soldier who gets a 
dose is a traitor.” It examined enlisted men twice a month for venereal dis-
ease, required any men infected to identify the person with whom or the 
building in which they had had sex, docked the pay of soldiers or sailors sick 
with venereal disease, and also made them subject to court-martial. With 
support from the most senior political leadership, the military by law pro-
hibited prostitution and the sale of alcohol within ﬁve miles of any base— 
and the military had seventy bases with ten thousand or more soldiers or 
sailors scattered around the country. The health boards of twenty-seven 
states passed regulations allowing detention of people suffering venereal 
infection “until they are no longer a danger to the community.” Eighty red-
light districts were shut down. Even New Orleans had to close down its leg-
endary Storyville, where prostitution was legal, where Buddy Bolden, Jelly 
Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, and others had invented jazz in the whore-
houses. And New Orleans mayor Martin Behrman was no reformer; he 
headed a political machine so tight it was called simply “the Ring.” 
But if Gorgas had the power to act decisively on venereal disease, if 
engineers listened to his sanitary experts in designing water supplies, the 
army paid him little heed on anything else. On no subject where he had 
only science behind him, science without political weight, could he get 
even a hearing from army superiors. Even when an American researcher 
developed an antitoxin for gangrene, Gorgas could not convince them to 
fund testing at the front. So Welch arranged for the Rockefeller Institute 
to pay the expenses of a team of investigators to go to Europe, and for 
the British army to test the antitoxin in British hospitals. (It worked, al-
though not perfectly.) 
In many ways, then, Gorgas, Welch, Vaughan, and their colleagues oper-
ated as a team independent of the army. But they could not operate inde-
pendently in regard to epidemic disease, and they could not operate either 
independently or alone as camps ﬁlled with hundreds of thousands—in 
fact, millions—of young men. 
When the war began there were one hundred forty thousand physicians 
in the United States. Only 776 of them were serving in the army or navy. 
"
"140 
The Great Influenza 
The military needed tens of thousands of physicians, and it needed 
them immediately. It would make no exceptions for scientists. Most would 
volunteer anyway. Most wanted to participate in this great crusade. 
Welch and Vaughan joined the military, despite their being one hun-
dred pounds overweight and past the regular army’s mandatory retire-
ment age, and they were not alone. Flexner joined at age ﬁfty-four. 
Flexner’s protégé Paul Lewis at Penn, Milton Rosenau at Harvard, and 
Eugene Opie at Washington University joined. All around the country 
laboratory scientists were joining. 
And to avoid losing scientists piecemeal either as volunteers or to the 
draft, Flexner suggested to Welch that the entire Rockefeller Institute be 
incorporated into the army. Welch carried the idea to Gorgas, and Gor-
gas’s deputy wired Flexner, “[U]nit will be arranged as you desire.” 
And so the Rockefeller Institute became Army Auxiliary Laboratory 
Number One. There would be no auxiliary laboratory number two. Men 
in uniforms marched down laboratory and hospital corridors. An army 
adjutant commanded the technicians and janitors, maintained army dis-
cipline among them, and drilled them on parade on York Avenue. Lunch 
became “mess.” A mobile hospital unit on wheels with buildings, wards, 
labs, laundry, and kitchen was rolled into the front yard of the institute 
from Sixty-fourth to Sixty-sixth Streets to treat soldiers with intractable 
wounds. Sergeants saluted scientists who—except for two Canadians 
who became privates—received ofﬁcer rank. 
This was no mere cosmetic change to allow life to go on as usual.* At 
Rockefeller the ﬁber of the work was rewoven. Nearly all research shifted 
to something war-related, or to instruction. Alexis Carrel, a Nobel laure-
ate in 1912 who pioneered the surgical reattachment of limbs and organ 
transplantation as well as tissue culture—he kept part of a chicken heart 
alive for thirty-two years—taught surgical techniques to hundreds of 
newly militarized physicians. Others taught bacteriology. A biochemist 
studied poison gas. Another chemist explored ways to get more acetone 
from starch, which could be used both in making explosives and to stiffen 
the fabric that covered airplane wings. Peyton Rous, who had already 
*During the Vietnam War many physician-scientists joined the Public Health Ser-
vice to avoid the draft. But their work did go on as usual. They were assigned to the 
National Institutes of Health, which enjoyed some of its most productive years in his-
tory because at the inﬂux of talent. 
"
"141 
The Tinderbox 
done the work that would later—decades later—win him a Nobel Prize, 
redirected his work to preserving blood; he developed a method still in 
use that led to the ﬁrst blood banks being established at the front in 1917. 
The war also consumed the supply of practicing physicians. Gorgas, 
Welch, and Vaughan had already laid plans for this. In December 1916 
they had, through the Council of National Defense, asked state medical 
associations to secretly grade physicians. Roughly half of all practicing 
physicians were judged incompetent to serve. So when America did enter 
the war, the military ﬁrst examined every male graduate of medical school 
in 1914, 1915, and 1916, seeking, as Vaughan said, the “best from these 
classes.” This would supply approximately ten thousand doctors. Many of 
the best medical schools also sent much of their faculty to France, where 
the schools functioned as intact units, stafﬁng and unofﬁcially lending 
their names to entire military hospitals. 
Yet these moves could not begin to satisfy the need. By the time the 
Armistice was signed thirty-eight thousand physicians would be serving 
in the military, at least half of all those under age forty-ﬁve considered ﬁt 
for service. 
The military, and especially the army, did not stop there. In April 1917 
the army had ﬁfty-eight dentists; in November 1918 it had 5,654. And the 
military needed nurses. 
There were too few nurses. Nursing had, like medicine, changed radically 
in the late nineteenth century. It too had become scientiﬁc. But changes 
in nursing involved factors that went beyond the purely scientiﬁc; they 
involved status, power, and the role of women. 
Nursing was one of the few ﬁelds that gave women opportunity and 
status, and that they controlled. While Welch and his colleagues were rev-
olutionizing American medicine, Jane Delano, Lavinia Dock—both of 
whom were students in Bellevue’s nursing program while Welch was 
exposing medical students there to new realities—and others were doing 
the same to nursing. But they fought not with an entrenched Old Guard 
in their own profession so much as with physicians. (Sometimes physi-
cians, threatened by intelligent and educated nurses, waged a virtual 
guerrilla war; in some hospitals physicians replaced labels on drug bottles 
with numbers so nurses could not question a prescription.) 
In 1912, before becoming surgeon general, Gorgas had anticipated 
"
"142 
The Great Influenza 
that if war ever came, the army would need vast numbers of nurses, many 
more than would likely be available. He believed, however, that not all of 
them would have to be fully trained. He wanted to create a corps of “prac-
tical nurses,” who lacked the education and training of “graduate nurses.” 
Others were also advancing this idea, but they were all men. The 
women who ran nursing would have none of it. Jane Delano had taught 
nursing and had headed the Army Nurse Corps. Proud and intelligent as 
well as tough, driven, and authoritarian, she had then just left the army to 
establish the Red Cross nursing program, and the Red Cross had all 
responsibility for supplying nurses to the army, evaluating, recruiting, 
and often assigning them. 
She rejected Gorgas’s plan, telling her colleagues it “seriously threat-
ened” the status of professional nursing and warning, “Our Nursing Ser-
vice would be of no avail with these groups of women unrelated to us, 
organized by physicians, taught by physicians, serving under their guid-
ance.” She told the Red Cross bluntly that “if this plan were put through I 
should at once sever my connection with the Red Cross . . .  [and] every 
member of the State and Local Committee would go out with me.”* 
The Red Cross and the army surrendered to her. No training of nurs-
ing aides commenced. When the United States entered the war it had 
98,162 “graduate nurses,” women whose training probably exceeded that 
of many—if not most—doctors trained before 1910. The war sucked up 
nurses as it sucked up everything else. In May 1918 roughly sixteen thou-
sand nurses were serving in the military. Gorgas believed that the army 
alone needed ﬁfty thousand. 
After Gorgas again pleaded with the Red Cross “to carry out the plans 
already formulated,” after learning conﬁdential information about the 
desperation in combat hospitals, Delano reversed herself, supported 
Gorgas, and tried to convince her colleagues of the need for “practical” 
nurses. 
Her professional colleagues rebuffed them both. They refused to par-
ticipate in organizing any large training program of such aides, and 
*It would seem nurses needed their status protected. In the summer of 1918, the 
Treasury Department informed the secretary of war that army nurses taken captive, 
unlike soldiers, were not entitled to pay while they were prisoners of war. Outrage 
later forced a reversal of this policy. 
"
"143 
The Tinderbox 
agreed only to establish an Army Nursing School. By October 1918 this 
new nursing school had produced not a single fully trained nurse. 
The triumph of the nursing profession at large over the Red Cross and 
the United States Army, an army at war, was extraordinary. That the vic-
tors were women made it more extraordinary. Ironically, this triumph 
reﬂected as well a triumph of George Creel’s Committee on Public Infor-
mation over the truth, for Creel’s propaganda machine had prevented the 
public from learning just how profound the need for nurses was. 
In the meantime the military’s appetite for doctors and nurses only 
grew. Four million American men were under arms with more coming, 
and Gorgas was planning for three hundred thousand hospital beds. The 
number of trained medical staff he had simply could not handle that 
load. So the military suctioned more and more nurses and physicians 
into cantonments, aboard ships, into France, until it had extracted nearly 
all the best young physicians. Medical care for civilians deteriorated rap-
idly. The doctors who remained in civilian life were largely either incom-
petent young ones or those over forty-ﬁve years of age, the vast majority 
of whom had been trained in the old ways of medicine. The shortage of 
nurses would prove even more serious. Indeed, it would prove deadly, 
especially in civil society. 
All this added kindling to the tinderbox. Still more kindling would 
come. 
"

ilson had demanded that “the spirit of ruthless brutality . . . 
enter into the very ﬁbre of national life.” To carry out that charge 
Creel had wanted to create “one white-hot mass,” a mass driven by 
“deathless determination.” He was doing so. This was truly total war, and 
that totality truly included the medical profession. 
Creel’s spirit even injected itself into Military Surgeon, a journal pub-
lished by the army for its physicians, which said, “Every single activity of 
this country is directed towards one single object, the winning of the war; 
nothing else counts now, and nothing will count ever if we don’t win it. 
No organization of any kind should be countenanced that has not this 
object in immediate view and is likely to help in the most efﬁcient 
way. . . . Thus  the medical sciences are applied to war, the arts are applied 
in perfecting camouﬂage, in reviving the spirits of our soldiers by enter-
tainment, etc.” 
This medical journal, this journal for physicians whose goal was to 
save life, also declared, “The consideration of human life often becomes 
quite secondary. . . .  The medical ofﬁcer has become more absorbed in 
the general than the particular, and the life and limb of the individual, 
while of great importance, are secondary to measures pro bono publico.” 
And this same journal expressed its opinion of what constituted pro 
bono publico when it quoted approvingly advice from Major Donald 
McRae, a combat veteran who said, “If any enemy wounded are found (in 
"
"145 
The Tinderbox 
the trench) they should be bayonetted, if sufﬁcient prisoners [for inter-
rogation] have been taken.” 
Gorgas did not share the views of the journal’s editors. When the investi-
gator funded by Rockefeller found his gangrene antitoxin effective, he 
wanted to publish his results—which could help the Germans. Both Gor-
gas and Secretary of War Newton Baker agreed that he should do so, and 
he did. Welch told Flexner, “I was very glad that both the Secretary and 
Surgeon General without any hesitation took this position.” 
But Gorgas had more important things to do than police the editors 
of Military Surgeon. He was focusing upon his mission, and he was pursu-
ing it with the obsessiveness of a missionary. For Gorgas had a nightmare. 
The U.S. Army had exploded from a few tens of thousands of soldiers 
before the war to millions in a few months. Huge cantonments, each 
holding roughly ﬁfty thousand men, were thrown together in a matter of 
weeks. Hundreds of thousands of men occupied them before the camps 
were completed. They were jammed into those barracks that were ﬁn-
ished, barracks designed for far less than their number, while tens of 
thousands of young soldiers lived through the ﬁrst winter in tents. Hos-
pitals were the last buildings to be constructed. 
These circumstances not only brought huge numbers of men into this 
most intimate proximity but exposed farm boys to city boys from hun-
dreds of miles away, each of them with entirely different disease immuni-
ties and vulnerabilities. Never before in American history—and possibly 
never before in any country’s history—had so many men been brought 
together in such a way. Even at the front in Europe, even with the impor-
tation there of labor from China, India, and Africa, the concentration 
and throwing together of men with different vulnerabilities may not have 
been as explosive a mix as that in American training camps. 
Gorgas’s nightmare was of an epidemic sweeping through those 
camps. Given the way troops moved from camp to camp, if an outbreak 
of infectious disease erupted in one, it would be extraordinarily difﬁcult 
to isolate that camp and keep the disease from spreading to others. Thou-
sands, possibly tens of thousands, could die. Such an epidemic might 
spread to the civilian population as well. Gorgas intended to do all within 
his power to prevent his nightmare from becoming real.

By 1917 medical science was far from helpless in the face of disease. It 
stood in fact on the banks of the river Styx. If it was able to wade into 
those waters and pull only a few people back from that crossing, in its 
laboratories lay the promise of much more. 
True, science had so far developed only a single one of the “magic bul-
lets” envisaged by Paul Ehrlich. He and a colleague had tried nine hundred 
different chemical compounds to cure syphilis before retesting the 606th 
one. It was an arsenic compound; this time they made it work, curing 
syphilis without poisoning the patient. Named salversan, it was often called 
just “606.” 
But science had achieved considerable success in manipulating the 
immune system and in public health. Vaccines prevented a dozen diseases 
that devastated livestock, including anthrax and hog cholera. Investiga-
tors had also gone far beyond the ﬁrst success against smallpox and were 
now developing vaccines to prevent a host of diseases as well as anti-
toxins and serums to cure them. Science had triumphed over diphtheria. 
Sanitary and public health measures were containing typhoid, cholera, 
yellow fever, and bubonic plague, and vaccines against typhoid, cholera, 
and plague also appeared. Antitoxin for snake bites went into produc-
tion. An antiserum for dysentery was found. A tetanus antitoxin brought 
magical results—before its widespread use, in 1903 in the United States 
102 people died out of every 1,000 treated for tetanus; ten years later uni-
versal use of the antitoxin lowered the death rate to 0 per 1,000 treated. 
Meningitis had been checked, if not conquered, largely by Flexner’s anti-
serum. In 1917 an antitoxin for gangrene was developed; although it was 
not nearly as effective as other antitoxins, scientists could improve it as 
they had improved others, over time. The possibilities of manipulating 
the immune system to defeat infectious disease seemed to hold enor-
mous promise.* 
At the management level Gorgas was taking action too. He saw to it 
*When antibiotics ﬁrst appeared in the late 1930s and 1940s, they performed like 
magic, and much of this research was abandoned; in the early 1960s, public health 
ofﬁcials were declaring victory over infectious disease. Now, with dozens of strains of 
bacteria developing resistance to drugs, with viruses gaining resistance even faster, 
with such diseases as tuberculosis, once considered conquered, making comebacks, 
investigators have returned to searching for ways to stimulate the immune system 
against everything from infections to cancer. 
"

that many of the new army doctors assigned to the cantonments were 
trained at the Rockefeller Institute by some of the best scientists in 
the world. He began stockpiling huge quantities of vaccines, antitoxins, 
and sera. He did not rely for these products on drug manufacturers; they 
were unreliable and often useless. In 1917 in fact New York State health 
commissioner Hermann Biggs tested commercial products for several 
diseases and found them so poor that he banned all sales from all drug 
manufacturers in New York State. So Gorgas assigned production to 
people he could rely upon. The Army Medical School would make enough 
typhoid vaccine for ﬁve million men. The Rockefeller Institute would 
produce sera for pneumonia, dysentery, and meningitis. The Hygienic 
Laboratory in Washington, which ultimately grew into the National 
Institutes of Health, would prepare smallpox vaccine and antitoxins for 
diphtheria and tetanus. 
He also transformed several railroad cars into the most modern labo-
ratory facilities—the equipping of these cars was paid for not by the gov-
ernment but by the Rockefeller Institute and the American Red 
Cross—and stationed these rolling laboratories at strategic points 
around the country, ready, as Flexner told Gorgas’s deputy for scientiﬁc 
matters, Colonel Frederick Russell, to “be sent to any one of the camps at 
which pneumonia or other epidemic disease prevails.” 
Also, even before construction began on the cantonments, Gorgas 
created a special unit for “the prevention of infectious disease.” He 
assigned the very best men to it. Welch, who had already toured British 
and French camps and was alert to possible weak points, headed this 
unit, and its ﬁve other members were Flexner, Vaughan, Russell, Biggs, 
and Rhode Island’s Charles Chapin. Each of them had international 
renown. They laid out precise procedures for the army to follow to min-
imize the chances of an epidemic. 
Meanwhile, as troops were pouring into the camps in 1917, Rocke-
feller Institute colleagues Rufus Cole, Oswald Avery, and others who 
had turned their focus to pneumonia issued a speciﬁc warning: “Although 
pneumonia occurs chieﬂy in endemic form, small and even large epi-
demics are not unknown. It was the most serious disease which threat-
ened the construction of the Panama Canal”—more so even than yellow 
fever, as Gorgas well knew—“and its prevalence in regions where large 
numbers of susceptible workers are brought together renders it of 
"
"148 
The Great Influenza 
great importance. . . . Pneumonia [seems] especially likely to attack raw 
recruits. The experience among the small number of troops in the Mexi-
can border, where pneumonia occurred in epidemic form [in 1916], 
should be a warning of what is likely to happen in our national army 
when large numbers of susceptible men are brought together during the 
winter months.” 
Gorgas’s army superiors ignored the advice. As a result, the army soon 
suffered a taste of epidemic disease. It would be a test run, for both a virus 
and medicine. 
The winter of 1917–18 was the coldest on record east of the Rocky 
Mountains, barracks were jam-packed, and hundreds of thousands of 
men were still living in tents. Camp hospitals and other medical facilities 
had not yet been ﬁnished. An army report conceded the failure to provide 
warm clothing or even heat. But most dangerous was the overcrowding. 
Flexner warned that the situation “was as if the men had pooled their 
diseases, each picking up the ones he had not had, . . . greatly assisted by 
the faulty laying out of the camps, poor administration, and lack of ade-
quate laboratory facilities.” Vaughan protested impotently and later called 
army procedures “insane. . . . How many lives were  sacriﬁced I can not 
estimate. . . .  The dangers in mobilization steps followed were pointed 
out to the proper authorities before there was any assembly, but the 
answer was: ‘The purpose of mobilization is to convert civilians into 
trained soldiers as quickly as possible and not to make a demonstration 
in preventive medicine.’” 
In that bitterly cold winter, measles came to the army’s barracks, and 
it came in epidemic form. Usually, of course, measles infects children and 
causes only fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and discomfort. But like many 
other children’s diseases—especially viral diseases—when measles strikes 
adults, it often strikes hard. (Early in the twenty-ﬁrst century, measles is 
still causing one million deaths a year worldwide.) 
This outbreak racked its victims with high fever, extreme sensitivity to 
light, and violent coughs. Complications included severe diarrhea, menin-
gitis, encephalitis (inﬂammation of the brain), violent ear infections, and 
convulsions. 
As infected soldiers moved from camp to camp, the virus moved with 
them, rolling through camps like a bowling ball knocking down pins.

Vaughan reported, “Not a troop train came into Camp Wheeler [near 
Macon, Georgia] in the fall of 1917 without bringing from one to six 
cases of measles already in the eruptive stage. These men . . . distributed 
its seeds at the encampment and on the train. No power on earth could 
stop the spread of measles under these conditions.” 
Camp Travis outside San Antonio held 30,067 men. By Christmas, 
4,571 men had come down with the disease. Funston had an average 
troop strength of over ﬁfty-six thousand; three thousand were sick enough 
to require hospitalization. At Greenleaf in South Carolina, Devens in 
Massachusetts, the numbers were comparable. The 25,260 troops at Camp 
Cody in New Mexico were free of measles until soon after the arrival of 
men from Funston. Then measles began roaring through Cody, too. 
And some young men began to die. 
Investigators could develop neither a vaccine to prevent measles nor a 
serum to cure it, but most deaths were coming chieﬂy from secondary 
infections, from bacteria invading the lungs after the virus had weak-
ened their defenses. And investigators at Rockefeller and elsewhere strug-
gled to ﬁnd a way to control these bacterial infections. They made some 
progress. 
Meanwhile the army issued orders forbidding men from crowding 
around stoves, and ofﬁcers entered barracks and tents to enforce it. But 
especially for the tens of thousands who lived in tents in the record cold, 
it was impossible to keep men from crowding around stoves. 
Of all the complications of measles, the most deadly by far was pneu-
monia. In the six months from September 1917 to March 1918, before 
the inﬂuenza epidemic struck, pneumonia struck down 30,784 soldiers 
on American soil. It killed 5,741 of them. Nearly all these pneumonia 
cases developed as complications of measles. At Camp Shelby, 46.5 per-
cent of all deaths—all deaths from all diseases, all car wrecks, all work 
accidents, all training mishaps combined—were a result of pneumonia 
following measles. At Camp Bowie, 227 soldiers died from disease in 
November and December 1917; 212 of them died of pneumonia after 
measles. The average death rate from pneumonia in twenty-nine canton-
ments was twelve times that of civilian men of the same age. 
In 1918 the Republican-controlled Senate held hearings on the Wilson 
administration’s mistakes in mobilizing the military. Republicans had

despised Wilson since 1912, when he reached the White House despite 
winning only 41 percent of the vote. (Former Republican president and 
then third-party candidate Teddy Roosevelt and incumbent Republican 
president William Howard Taft split the GOP vote, and Socialist Eugene 
Debs also won 6 percent.) Mobilization failures seemed a perfect oppor-
tunity to embarrass him. And there was personal bitterness in the attacks: 
Congressman Augustus Peabody Gardner, son-in-law of Senate Majority 
Leader Henry Cabot Lodge, had resigned from Congress and enlisted, 
only to die of pneumonia in camp. 
Gorgas was summoned to explain the measles ﬁasco. His testimony 
and his report on the epidemic to the chief of staff made front-page 
news. Like his mentor Sternberg during the typhoid debacle twenty years 
earlier, he lacerated his War Department colleagues and superiors for 
rushing troops to cantonments under living conditions that failed to 
meet minimum public health standards, for overcrowding, for exposing 
recruits to measles who had no immunity, for using untrained “country 
boys” to care for desperately sick men in poorly equipped hospitals and 
sometimes without hospitals at all. And he stated that the War Depart-
ment seemed to consider the Medical Department of the army unimpor-
tant. “I was never in their conﬁdence, no,” he said in response to one 
senator’s question. 
He had hoped his testimony would force the army to give him more 
power to protect troops. Perhaps it did; the army initiated courts-martial 
at three cantonments. But his testimony also isolated him. He conﬁded 
to his sister that, in the War Department, “All my friends seem to have 
deserted me and everybody is giving me a kick as I pass by.” 
Meanwhile, Welch visited one of the worst-hit camps, a camp where 
measles itself had left but where victims with complications still lingered. 
He told Gorgas that the mortality rate for troops developing pneumonia 
after measles “is stated to be 30% but more now in hospital will die. A 
good statistician needed in hospital—registrar not competent.” To give 
the men in the hospital a better chance to survive, he continued, “Have 
Colonel Russell send directions for Avery’s medicine for pneumococcus 
type work.” 
He was referring to the Rockefeller Institute’s Oswald Avery, one of 
the Canadians there who had been inducted into the army as only a pri-
vate. Private or not, he soon would be, if he was not already, the world’s

leading investigator of pneumonia. And conclusions Avery would reach 
would have import far—very, very far—beyond that subject. His ﬁndings 
would create a scientiﬁc revolution that would change the direction of all 
genetic research and create modern molecular biology. But that would 
come later. 
Osler called pneumonia “the captain of the men of death.” Pneumo-
nia was the leading cause of death around the world, greater than tuber-
culosis, greater than cancer, greater than heart disease, greater than 
plague. 
And, like measles, when inﬂuenza kills, it usually kills through pneu-
monia. 
"

edical dictionaries deﬁne pneumonia as “an inﬂammation of 
the lungs with consolidation.” This deﬁnition omits mention of an 
infection, but in practice pneumonia is almost always caused by some 
kind of microorganism invading the lung, followed by an infusion of the 
body’s infection-ﬁghting weapons. The resulting inﬂamed mix of cells, 
enzymes, cell debris, ﬂuid, and the equivalent of scar tissue thickens and 
leads to the consolidation; then the lung, normally soft and spongy, 
becomes ﬁrm, solid, inelastic. The disease kills usually when either the 
consolidation becomes so widespread that the lungs cannot transfer 
enough oxygen into the bloodstream, or the pathogen enters the blood-
stream and carries the infection throughout the body. 
Pneumonia maintained its position as the leading cause of death in 
the United States until 1936. It and inﬂuenza are so closely linked that 
modern international health statistics, including those compiled by the 
United States Centers for Disease Control, routinely classify them as a 
single cause of death. Even now, early in the twenty-ﬁrst century, with 
antibiotics, antiviral drugs, oxygen, and intensive-care units, inﬂuenza 
and pneumonia combined routinely rank as the ﬁfth or sixth—it varies 
year to year, usually depending on the severity of the inﬂuenza season— 
leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of death 
from infectious disease. 
Inﬂuenza causes pneumonia either directly, by a massive viral invasion

The Tinderbox 
of the lungs, or indirectly—and more commonly—by destroying certain 
parts of the body’s defenses and allowing so-called secondary invaders, 
bacteria, to infest the lungs virtually unopposed. There is also evidence 
that the inﬂuenza virus makes it easier for some bacteria to invade the 
lung not only by generally wiping out defense mechanisms but by specif-
ically facilitating some bacteria’s ability to attach to lung tissue. 
Although many bacteria, viruses, and fungi can invade the lung, the single 
most common cause of pneumonia is the pneumococcus, a bacterium 
that can be either a primary or secondary invader. (It causes approxi-
mately 95 percent of lobar pneumonias, involving one or more entire 
lobes, although a far lesser percentage of bronchopneumonias.) George 
Sternberg, while working in a makeshift laboratory on an army post in 
1881, ﬁrst isolated this bacterium from his own saliva, inoculated rabbits 
with it, and learned that it killed. He did not recognize the disease as 
pneumonia. Neither did Pasteur, who discovered the same organism later 
but published ﬁrst, so scientiﬁc etiquette gives him priority in the discov-
ery. Three years later a third investigator demonstrated that this bacteria 
frequently colonized the lungs and caused pneumonia, hence its name. 
Under the microscope the pneumococcus looks like a typical strepto-
coccus, a medium-size elliptical or round bacterium usually linked with 
others in a chain, although the pneumococcus usually is linked only to 
one other bacterium—and is sometimes called a diplococcus—like two 
pearls side by side. When exposed to sunlight it dies within ninety min-
utes, but it survives in moist sputum in a dark room for ten days. It can 
be found occasionally on dust particles. In virulent form, it can be highly 
infectious—in fact it can itself cause epidemics. 
As early as 1892 scientists tried to make a serum to treat it. They 
failed. In the next decades, while investigators were making enormous 
advances against other diseases, they made almost no progress against 
pneumonia. This was not through lack of trying. Whenever researchers 
made any progress against diphtheria, plague, typhoid, meningitis, tetanus, 
snake bite, and other killers, they immediately applied the same methods 
against pneumonia. Still nothing even hinted at success. 
Investigators were working at the very outermost edge of science. 
Gradually they improved their ability to produce a serum that protected 
an animal, but not people. And they struggled to understand how this 
"
"154 
The Great Influenza 
serum worked, advancing hypotheses that might eventually lead to ther-
apies. Sir Almroth Wright, who was knighted for developing a typhoid 
vaccine, speculated that the immune system coated invading organisms 
with what he called “opsonins,” which made it far easier for white blood 
cells to devour the invader. His insight was correct, but he was wrong in 
the conclusions he drew from this insight. 
Nowhere was pneumonia more severe than among workers in South 
Africa’s gold and diamond mines. Epidemic conditions were virtually 
constant and outbreaks routinely killed 40 percent of the men who got 
sick. In 1914 South African mine owners asked Wright to devise a vaccine 
against pneumonia. He claimed success. In fact he not only failed, his 
vaccinations could kill. This and other errors earned Wright the mocking 
nickname “Sir Almost Right” from competing investigators. 
But by then two German scientists had found a clue to the problem in 
treating or preventing pneumonia. In 1910 they distinguished between 
what they called “typical” pneumococci and “atypical” pneumococci. 
They and others tried to develop this clue. 
Yet as the Great War began so little progress had been made against 
pneumonia that Osler himself still recommended venesection—bleeding: 
“We employ it nowadays much more than we did a few years ago, but 
more often late in the disease than early. To bleed at the very onset in 
robust, healthy individuals in whom the disease sets in with great inten-
sity and high fever is, I believe, a good practice.” 
Osler did not claim that bleeding cured pneumonia, only that it might 
relieve certain symptoms. He was wrong. The 1916 edition of his text-
book also stated, “Pneumonia is a self-limited disease, which can neither 
be aborted nor cut short by any known means at our command.” 
Americans were about to challenge that conclusion. 
When Rufus Cole came to the Rockefeller Institute to head its hospital, he 
decided to focus most of his own energies and those of the team he put 
together on pneumonia. It was an obvious choice, since it was the biggest 
killer. 
To cure or prevent pneumonia required, as with all other infectious 
diseases at the time, manipulating the body’s own defenses, the immune 
system. 
In the diseases scientists could defeat, the antigen—the molecules on 
"
"155 
The Tinderbox 
the surfaces of invading organisms that stimulated the immune system to 
respond, the target the immune response aimed at—did not change. In 
diphtheria the dangerous part was not even the bacteria itself but a toxin 
the bacteria produced. 
The toxin was not alive, did not evolve, and had a ﬁxed form, and the 
production of antitoxin had become routine. Horses were injected with 
gradually increasing doses of virulent bacteria. The bacteria made the 
toxin. In turn, the horse’s immune system generated antibodies that bound 
to and neutralized the toxin. The horse was then bled, solids removed 
from the blood until only the serum remained, and this was then puriﬁed 
into the antitoxin that had become so common and lifesaving. 
An identical process produced tetanus antitoxin, Flexner’s serum 
against meningitis, and several other sera or antitoxins. Scientists were 
vaccinating the horse against a disease, then extracting the horse anti-
bodies and injecting them into people. This borrowing of immune-
system defenses from an outside source is called “passive immunity.” 
When vaccines are used to stimulate people’s own immune systems 
directly, so that they develop their own defenses against bacteria or 
viruses, it is called “active immunity.” 
But in all the diseases treated successfully so far, the antigens, the tar-
get the immune system aimed at, remained constant. The target stayed 
still; it did not move. And so the target was easy to hit. 
The pneumococcus was different. The discovery of “typical” and 
“atypical” pneumococci had opened a door, and investigators were now 
ﬁnding many types of the bacteria. Different types had different antigens. 
Sometimes also the same type was virulent, sometimes not, but why one 
killed and another caused mild or no disease was not yet a question any-
one was designing experiments to answer. That lay out there for the 
future, a sort of undertow pulling at the data. The focus was far more 
immediate: ﬁnding a curative serum, a preventative vaccine, or both. 
By 1912 Cole at Rockefeller had developed a serum that had measur-
able if not dramatic curative power against a single type of pneumo-
coccus. He happened to read a paper by Avery on an entirely different 
subject—secondary infections in victims of tuberculosis. Although nar-
row and hardly a classic, the paper still made a deep impression on Cole. 
It was solid, thorough, tight, and yet was deeply analytical, showing 
an awareness of the potential implications of the conclusions and pos-

sible new directions for research. It also demonstrated Avery’s knowl-
edge of chemistry and ability to carry out a fully scientiﬁc laboratory 
investigation of illness in patients. Cole wrote Avery a note offering 
him a job at the institute. Avery did not reply. Cole sent a second note. 
Still he received no reply. Finally Cole visited Avery and raised the salary 
offer. Later he realized Avery rarely read his mail. It was typical of Avery; 
his focus was always on his experiments. Now he accepted. Soon after the 
Great War started, but before America’s entry into it, Avery also began 
working on pneumonia. 
Pneumonia was Cole’s passion. For Avery it would become an obsession. 
Oswald Avery was a short thin fragile man, a tiny man really who 
weighed at most 110 pounds. With his large head and intense eyes, he 
looked like someone who would have been laughed at as an “egghead,” if 
that word had been in use then, and bullied in a schoolyard as a boy. If 
that was the case, it appeared to have left no scars; he seemed friendly, 
cheerful, even outgoing. 
Born in Montreal, he grew up in New York City the son of a Baptist 
minister who preached at a church in the city. He had a good many tal-
ents. At Colgate University he tied for ﬁrst prize in an oratory contest 
with classmate Harry Emerson Fosdick, who became among the most 
prominent preachers of the early twentieth century (Fosdick’s brother 
Raymond ultimately headed the Rockefeller Foundation; John Rocke-
feller Sr. built Riverside Church for Harry). Avery also played cornet well 
enough to have performed in concert with the National Conservatory of 
Music—a concert conducted by Antonin Dvorˇák—and he often drew ink 
caricatures and painted landscapes. 
Yet for all his outward friendliness and sociability, Avery spoke him-
self of what he called “the true inwardness of research.” 
René Dubos, an Avery protégé, recalled, “To a few of us who saw him 
in every day life, however, there was often revealed another aspect of his 
personality, . . . a more  haunting quality, . . . a melancholy ﬁgure whist-
ling gently to himself the lonely tune of the shepherd song in Tristan and 
Isolde. An acute need for privacy, even if it had to be bought at the cost of 
loneliness, conditioned much of Avery’s behavior.” 
If the phone rang Avery would talk animatedly, as if happy to hear 
from the caller, but when he hung up, Dubos recalled, “It was as if a mask

dropped, his smile replaced with a tired and almost tortured expression, 
the telephone pushed away on the desk as a symbol of protest against the 
encroaching world.” 
Like Welch, he never married, nor was he known to have had an emo-
tional or intimate relationship with anyone of either sex. Like Welch, he 
could be charming and the center of attention; he did comic imperson-
ations so well that one colleague called him “a natural born comedian.” 
Yet he resented any kind of intrusion upon himself, resented even attempts 
by others to entertain him. 
Everything else about him was the opposite of Welch. Welch read 
widely, had curiosity about everything, traveled throughout Europe, China, 
and Japan, and seemed to embrace the universe. Welch often sought 
relaxation in elaborate dinners and almost daily retreated to his club. And 
Welch as a very young man was recognized as marked for great things. 
Avery was none of those things. He was certainly not considered a 
brilliant young investigator. When Cole hired him, he was almost forty 
years old. By forty Welch was moving in the highest circles of science 
internationally. By forty those of Avery’s contemporaries who would leave 
any signiﬁcant scientiﬁc legacy had already made names for themselves. 
Yet Avery, like much younger investigators at Rockefeller, was essentially 
on probation and had made no particular mark. Indeed, he had made no 
mark—but not from want of ambition, nor from lack of work. 
While Welch constantly socialized and traveled, Avery had almost no 
personal life. He ﬂed from one. He almost never entertained and rarely 
went out to dinner. Although he was close to and felt responsible for his 
younger brother and an orphaned cousin, his life, his world, was his re-
search. All else was extraneous. Once the editor of a scientiﬁc journal 
asked him to write a memorial piece about Nobel laureate Karl Land-
steiner, with whom he had worked closely at Rockefeller. In it Avery said 
nothing whatsoever about Landsteiner’s personal life. The editor asked 
him to insert some personal details. Avery refused, stating that personal 
information would help the reader understand nothing that mattered, 
neither Landsteiner’s achievements nor his thought processes. 
(Landsteiner likely would have approved Avery’s treatment. When he 
was notiﬁed he’d won the Nobel Prize, he continued working in his labo-
ratory all day, got home so late that his wife was asleep, and did not wake 
her to give her the news.) 
"
"158 
The Great Influenza 
The research mattered, Avery was saying, not the life. And the life of 
research, like that of any art, lay within. As Einstein once said,“One of the 
strongest motives that lead persons to art or science is a ﬂight from the 
everyday  life. . . . With this negative motive goes a positive one. Man 
seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a sim-
pliﬁed and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of 
experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is 
what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the nat-
ural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he 
places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the 
peace and serenity that he cannot ﬁnd within the narrow conﬁnes of 
swirling personal experience.” 
With the possible exception of his love for music, Avery seemed to 
have no existence outside the laboratory. For years he shared the same 
apartment with Alphonse Dochez, another bachelor scientist who 
worked closely with him at Rockefeller, and a shifting cast of more tem-
porary scientist-roommates who left when they got married or changed 
jobs. Avery’s roommates lived normal lives, going out, going away for a 
weekend. When they came home, there would be Avery, ready to begin a 
lengthy conversation that lasted deep into the night about an experimen-
tal problem or result. 
But if Avery had little personal life, he did have ambition. His desire to 
make a mark after so long in the wilderness led him to publish two papers 
soon after he arrived at Rockefeller. In the ﬁrst, based on only a few 
experiments, he and Dochez formulated “a sweeping metabolic theory of 
virulence and immunity.” In the second, Avery again reached well beyond 
his experimental evidence for a conclusion. 
Both were quickly proved wrong. Humiliated, he was determined 
never to suffer such embarrassment again. He became extraordinarily care-
ful, extraordinarily cautious and conservative, in anything he published 
or even said outside his own laboratory. He did not stop speculating— 
privately—about the boldest and most far-reaching interpretations of an 
experiment, but from then on he published only the most rigorously 
tested and conservative conclusions. From then on, Avery would only— 
in public—inch his way forward. An inch at a time, he would ultimately 
cover an enormous and startling distance.

When one inches along progress comes slowly, but it can still be decisive. 
Cole and Avery worked together precisely the way Cole had hoped for 
when he organized the Rockefeller hospital. More importantly, the work 
produced results. 
In the laboratory Avery and Dochez took the lead. They worked in 
simple laboratories with simple equipment. Each room had a single deep 
porcelain sink and several worktables, each with a gas outlet for a Bunsen 
burner and drawers underneath. The tabletop space was ﬁlled with racks 
of test tubes, simple mason jars, petri dishes—droppers for various dyes 
and chemicals, and tin cans holding pipettes and platinum loops. On the 
same tabletop investigators performed nearly all their work: inoculating, 
bleeding, and dissecting animals. Also on the tabletop was a cage for the 
occasional animal kept as a pet. In the middle of the room were incuba-
tors, vacuum pumps, and centrifuges. 
First they replicated earlier experiments, partly to familiarize themselves 
with techniques. They exposed rabbits and mice to gradually increasing 
dosages of pneumococci. Soon the animals developed antibodies to the 
bacteria. They drew blood from them, allowed solids to settle out, si-
phoned off the serum, added chemicals to precipitate remaining solids, then 
puriﬁed the serum by passing it through several ﬁlters. Others had done 
the equivalent. They succeeded in curing mice with the serum. Others 
had done that, too. But the mice were not people. 
In a way, they weren’t really mice either. Scientists had to keep as many 
factors constant as possible, limit variables, to make it easier to under-
stand precisely what caused an experimental result. So mice were inbred 
until all mice in a given strain had virtually identical genes, except for sex 
differences. (Male mice were and are generally not used in experiments 
because they sometimes attack each other; the death or injury of a single 
mouse for any reason can distort experimental results and ruin weeks of 
work.) These mice were fully alive but also model systems, with as much 
of the complexity, diversity, and spontaneity of life eliminated as possi-
ble; they were bred to be as close to a test tube as a living thing can be.* 
*The same genetic lines of laboratory mice used by Avery are still in use today; the 
mice have been inbred since at least 1909 to be a useful tool. As one scientist at the 
National Cancer Institute says, “I can cure cancer in a mouse one hundred percent of 
the time. If you can’t do that, you may as well hang it up.” 
"
"160 
The Great Influenza 
But if scientists were curing mice, no one anywhere had made any 
progress in curing people. Experiment after experiment had failed. Else-
where other investigators trying similar approaches quit, convinced by 
their failures that their theories were wrong or that their techniques were 
not good enough to yield results—or they simply grew impatient and 
moved on to easier problems. 
Avery did not move on. He saw snatches of evidence suggesting he 
was right. He persisted, experimenting repeatedly, trying to learn from 
each failure. He and Dochez grew hundreds of cultures of pneumococci, 
changing the strains, learning more and more about its metabolism, 
changing the composition of the media in which the bacteria grew. (Soon 
Avery became one of the best in the world at ﬁguring out what medium 
would most effectively grow different bacteria.) His background in both 
chemistry and immunology began paying off, and they used every piece 
of information as a wedge, pounding it into the problem, cracking or 
prying open other secrets, improving techniques, and, ﬁnally, gradually 
inching past the work that others had done. 
They and others identiﬁed three fairly uniform and common strains 
of pneumococci, which they called simply Type I, Type II, and Type III. 
Other pneumococci were designated as Type IV, a catchall for dozens of 
other strains (ninety have been identiﬁed) that appeared less often. The 
ﬁrst three types gave them a far more speciﬁc target for an antiserum, 
which they made. When they exposed different cultures of pneumococci 
to the serum they discovered that the antibodies in the serum would bind 
only to its matching culture and not to any other. The binding was even 
visible in a test tube without a microscope; the bacteria and antibodies 
clumped together. The process was called “agglutination” and was a test 
for speciﬁcity. 
But many things that work in vitro, in the narrow universe of a test 
tube, fail in vivo, in the nearly inﬁnite complexity of life. Now they went 
through the cycle of testing in rabbits and mice again, testing different 
strains of the bacteria in animals for killing potential, testing how well 
they generated antibodies, how well the antibodies bound to them. They 
tried injecting massive dosages of killed bacteria, thinking it might spark 
a large immune response, then using the serum generated by that tech-
nique. They tried mixing small doses of living bacteria and massive doses 
"
"161 
The Tinderbox 
of dead ones. They tried live bacteria. In mice they ultimately achieved 
spectacular cure rates. 
At the same time, Avery’s understanding of the bacteria deepened. It 
deepened enough that he forced scientists to change their thinking about 
the immune system. 
One of the most puzzling aspects of pneumococci was that some were 
virulent and lethal, some were not. Avery thought he had a clue to the answer 
to this question. He and Dochez focused on the fact that some pneumo-
cocci—but only some—were surrounded by a capsule made of polysac-
charides, a sugar, like the hard shell of sugar surrounding the soft insides 
of M&M candy. Avery’s very ﬁrst paper on the pneumococcus, in 1917, 
dealt with these “speciﬁc soluble substances.” He would pursue this sub-
ject for more than a quarter of a century. As he tried to unravel this puz-
zle, he began calling the pneumococcus, this killing bacterium, the 
“sugar-coated microbe.” His pursuit would yield a momentous discovery 
and a deep understanding of life itself. 
Meanwhile, with the rest of the Western world already at war, Cole, 
Avery, Dochez, and their colleagues were ready to test their immune 
serum in people.

ven when Cole ﬁrst tried the new serum on patients it showed 
promise. He and Avery immediately devoted themselves to reﬁning 
their procedures in the laboratory, in the methods of infecting horses and 
producing serum, in the way they administered it. Finally they began a 
careful series of trials with a ﬁnished product. They found that giving 
large dosages of serum—half a liter—intravenously cut the death rate of 
Type I pneumonias by more than half, from 23 percent to 10 percent. 
It was not a cure. Pneumonias caused by other types of pneumococci 
did not yield so easily. And, as Avery and Cole stated, “Protection in man 
is inferior to protection in mice.” 
But of all pneumonias, those caused by Type I pneumococci were the 
single most common. Cutting the death rate by more than half in the single 
most common pneumonia was progress, real progress, enough progress 
that in 1917 the institute published a ninety-page monograph by Cole, 
Avery, Dochez, and Henry Chickering, another young Rockefeller scien-
tist, entitled “Acute Lobar Pneumonia Prevention and Serum Treatment.” 
It was a landmark work, for the ﬁrst time explaining step-by-step a way 
to prepare and use a serum that could cure pneumonia. And it very much 
anticipated outbreaks of the disease in army cantonments, noting, “Pneu-
monia bids fair in the present war to lead all diseases as a cause of death.” 
In October 1917, Gorgas told army hospital commanders that, “in 
view of the probability that pneumonia will be one of the most impor-

tant diseases amongst the troops,” they must send even more doctors to 
the Rockefeller Institute to learn how to prepare and administer this serum. 
Avery, still a private, was already diverting time from his research to teach 
bacteriology to ofﬁcers who would be working in cantonments. Now he 
and his colleagues also taught this serum therapy. His students, rather 
than call him “Private,” addressed him respectfully as “Professor”—a 
nickname already occasionally given him. His colleagues shortened it to 
“Fess,” which stuck with him for the rest of his life. 
Simultaneously Cole, Avery, and Dochez were developing a vaccine to 
prevent pneumonia caused by Types I, II, and III pneumococci. After 
proving it worked in animals, they and six other Rockefeller researchers 
turned themselves into guinea pigs, testing its safety in humans by giving 
each other massive doses. All of them had negative reactions to the vac-
cine itself; three had severe reactions. They decided that the vaccine was 
too dangerous to administer in those dosages but planned another exper-
iment with lower doses administered once a week for four weeks, which 
gave recipients time to gradually build up immunity. 
This vaccine came too late for any large-scale impact on the measles 
epidemic, but at Camp Gordon outside Atlanta, a vaccine against the 
strain of pneumococcus causing most of the pneumonias there was 
tested on one hundred men with measles, with ﬁfty men vaccinated and 
ﬁfty used as controls. Only two of those vaccinated developed this pneu-
monia, compared to fourteen unvaccinated men. 
Meanwhile, Cole wrote Colonel Frederick Russell, who during his 
own scientiﬁc career in the army had signiﬁcantly improved typhoid 
vaccine, about “the progress we have already made in the matter of pro-
phylactic vaccination against pneumonia.” But, Cole added, “The manu-
facture of large amounts of vaccine will be a big matter, much more 
difﬁcult than the manufacture of typhoid vaccine. . . . I have been getting  
an organization together so that the large amounts of media necessary 
could be prepared, and so the vaccine could be made on a large scale.” 
Cole’s organization was ready for a large test in March 1918, just as 
inﬂuenza was ﬁrst surfacing among soldiers in Kansas. The vaccine was 
given to twelve thousand troops at Camp Upton on Long Island—that 
used up all the vaccine available—while nineteen thousand troops served 
as controls, receiving no vaccine. Over the next three months, not a sin-
gle vaccinated soldier developed pneumonia caused by any of the types 
"
"164 
The Great Influenza 
of pneumococci vaccinated against. The controls suffered 101 cases. This 
result was not absolutely conclusive. But it was more than suggestive. And 
it was a far better result than was being achieved anywhere else in the 
world. The Pasteur Institute was also testing a pneumonia vaccine, but 
without success. 
If Avery and Cole could develop a serum or vaccine with real effec-
tiveness against the captain of death . . . If they could do that, it would be 
the greatest triumph medical science had yet known. 
Both the prospect of ﬁnally being able to defeat pneumonia and its 
appearance in the army camps only intensiﬁed Gorgas’s determination to 
ﬁnd a way to limit its killing. He asked Welch to create and chair a special 
board on the disease. Gorgas wanted the board run, literally, out of his 
own ofﬁce; Welch’s desk was in Gorgas’s personal ofﬁce. 
Welch demurred and called Flexner. Both men agreed that the best 
man in the country, and probably in the world, to chair the board was 
Rufus Cole. The next day Flexner and Cole got on a train to Washington 
to meet Gorgas and Welch at the Cosmos Club. There they picked the 
members of the pneumonia board, a board to be supported by all the 
knowledge and resources of Gorgas, Welch, Flexner, and the institutions 
they represented. 
They chose well. Each person selected would later be elected to mem-
bership in the National Academy of Sciences, arguably the most exclusive 
scientiﬁc organization in the world. 
Avery would of course lead the actual laboratory investigations and 
stay in New York. Most of the others would work in the ﬁeld. Lieutenant 
Thomas Rivers, a Hopkins graduate and Welch protégé, would become 
one of the world’s leading virologists and succeed Cole as head of the 
Rockefeller Institute Hospital. Lieutenant Francis Blake, another Rocke-
feller researcher, would become dean of the Yale Medical School. Captain 
Eugene Opie, regarded as one of the most brilliant of Welch’s pathology 
students, was already dean of the Washington University Medical School 
when he joined the army. Collaborating with them, although not actual 
board members, were future Nobel laureates Karl Landsteiner at Rocke-
feller and George Whipple at the Hopkins. Years later another Rockefeller 
scientist recalled, “It was really a privilege to be on the pneumonia team.” 
On a routine basis—if such urgency could be routine—Cole traveled 
"
"165 
The Tinderbox 
to Washington to discuss the latest ﬁndings with Welch and senior army 
medical ofﬁcers in Gorgas’s ofﬁce. Cole, Welch, Victor Vaughan, and Rus-
sell had also been conducting a series of the most rigorous inspection 
tours of cantonments, checking on everything from the quality of the 
camp’s surgeons, bacteriologists, and epidemiologists right down to the 
way camp kitchens washed dishes. Any recommendations they made 
were immediately ordered to be carried out. But they did not simply dic-
tate; many of the camp hospitals and laboratories were run by men they 
respected, and they listened to ideas as well. 
Late that spring, Cole reported to the American Medical Association 
one of his conclusions about measles: that it “seems to render the respi-
ratory mucous membrane especially susceptible to secondary infection.” 
He also believed that these secondary infections, like measles itself, 
“occur chieﬂy in epidemic form. . . . Every  new case of the infection adds 
not only to the extent but also to the intensity of the epidemic.” 
On June 4, 1918, Cole, Welch, and several other members of the 
pneumonia board appeared in Gorgas’s ofﬁce once more, this time with 
Hermann Biggs, New York State health commissoner; Milton Rosenau, 
a prominent Harvard scientist who was then a navy lieutenant com-
mander; and L. Emmett Holt, one of those instrumental in the founding 
of the Rockefeller Institute. This time the discussion was wide-ranging, 
focusing on how to minimize the possibility of something worse than the 
measles epidemic. They were all worried about Gorgas’s nightmare. 
They were not particularly worried about inﬂuenza, although they 
were tracking outbreaks of the disease. For the moment those outbreaks 
were mild, not nearly as dangerous as the measles epidemic had been. 
They well knew that when inﬂuenza kills, it kills through pneumonia, but 
Gorgas had already asked the Rockefeller Institute to gear up its produc-
tion and study of pneumonia serum and vaccine, and both the institute 
and the Army Medical School had launched major efforts to do so. 
Then the conversation turned from the laboratory to epidemiological 
issues. The inspection tours of the camps had convinced Welch, Cole, 
Vaughan, and Russell that cross-infections had caused many of the 
measles-related pneumonia deaths. To prevent such a problem from re-
curring, Cole suggested creating contagious-disease wards with specially 
trained staffs, something the best civilian hospitals had. Welch pointed 
out that the British had isolation hospitals with entirely separate organiza-
"
"166 
The Great Influenza 
tions and rigid discipline. Another possible solution to cross-infection 
involved using cubicles in hospitals—creating a warren of partitions 
around hospital beds. 
They also discussed overcrowding in hospitals and isolation of 
troops. Since 1916 the Canadian army had segregated all troops arriving 
in Britain for twenty-eight days, to prevent their infecting any trained 
troops ready to go to the front. Welch advised establishing similar “deten-
tion camps for new recruits where men are kept for 10–14 days.” 
They all recognized the difﬁculty of convincing the army to do this, or 
of convincing the army to end the even more serious problem of over-
crowding in barracks. 
Still, another army medical ofﬁcer injected one piece of good news. 
He said that the problem of overcrowding in the hospitals themselves had 
been eliminated. Every hospital in the army had at least one hundred 
empty beds as of May 15, with a total of twenty-three thousand beds 
empty. Every single epidemiological statistic the army collected showed 
improved overall health. He insisted that facilities and training were ade-
quate. 
Time would tell. 
Man might be deﬁned as “modern” largely to the extent that he attempts 
to control, as opposed to adjust himself to, nature. In this relationship 
with nature, modern humanity has generally been the aggressor and a 
daring one at that, altering the ﬂow of rivers, building upon geological 
faults, and, today, even engineering the genes of existing species. Nature 
has generally been languid in its response, although contentious once 
aroused and occasionally displaying a ﬂair for violence. 
By 1918 humankind was fully modern, and fully scientiﬁc, but too 
busy ﬁghting itself to aggress against nature. Nature, however, chooses 
its own moments. It chose this moment to aggress against man, and it 
did not do so prodding languidly. For the ﬁrst time, modern humanity, a 
humanity practicing the modern scientiﬁc method, would confront nature 
in its fullest rage.

t is impossible to prove that someone from Haskell County, Kansas, 
carried the inﬂuenza virus to Camp Funston. But the circumstantial 
evidence is strong. In the last week of February 1918, Dean Nilson, Ernest 
Elliot, John Bottom, and probably several others unnamed by the local 
paper traveled from Haskell, where “severe inﬂuenza” was raging, to Fun-
ston. They probably arrived between February 28 and March 2, and the 
camp hospital ﬁrst began receiving soldiers with inﬂuenza on March 4. 
This timing precisely ﬁts the incubation period of inﬂuenza. Within 
three weeks eleven hundred troops at Funston were sick enough to 
require hospitalization. 
Only a trickle of people moved back and forth between Haskell and 
Funston, but a river of soldiers moved between Funston, other army 
bases, and France. Two weeks after the ﬁrst case at Funston, on March 18, 
inﬂuenza surfaced at both Camps Forrest and Greenleaf in Georgia; 10 
percent of the forces at both camps would report sick. Then, like falling 
dominoes, other camps erupted with inﬂuenza. In total, twenty-four of 
the thirty-six largest army camps experienced an inﬂuenza outbreak that 
spring. Thirty of the ﬁfty largest cities in the country, most of them adja-
cent to military facilities, also suffered an April spike in “excess mortality” 
from inﬂuenza, although that did not become clear except in hindsight. 
At ﬁrst it seemed like nothing to worry about, nothing like the measles 
outbreak with its pneumonic complications. Only in Haskell had inﬂuenza 
"
"170 
The Great Influenza 
been severe. The only thing at all worrisome was that the disease was 
moving. 
As Macfarlane Burnet later said, “It is convenient to follow the story of 
inﬂuenza at this period mainly in regard to the army experiences in 
America and Europe.” 
After the pandemic, outstanding epidemiologists searched military and 
civilian health records in the United States for any signs of uncommon 
inﬂuenza activity prior to the Funston outbreak. They found none. (The 
warning published about Haskell misstated the date, incorrectly putting 
it after Funston.) In France there had been some localized ﬂare-ups of 
inﬂuenza during the winter, but they did not seem to spread and behaved 
like endemic, not epidemic, disease. 
The ﬁrst unusual outbreaks in Europe occurred in Brest in early April, 
where American troops disembarked. In Brest itself a French naval com-
mand was suddenly crippled. And from Brest the disease did spread, and 
quickly, in concentric circles. 
Still, although many got sick, these outbreaks were, like those in the 
United States, generally mild. Troops were temporarily debilitated, then 
recovered. For example, an epidemic erupted near Chaumont involving 
U.S. troops and civilians: of 172 marines guarding headquarters there, most 
fell ill and ﬁfty-four required hospitalization—but all of them recovered. 
The ﬁrst appearance in the French army came April 10. Inﬂuenza 
struck Paris in late April, and at about the same time the disease reached 
Italy. In the British army the ﬁrst cases occurred in mid-April, then the 
disease exploded. In May the British First Army alone suffered 36,473 
hospital admissions and tens of thousands of less serious cases. In the 
Second Army, a British report noted, “At the end of May it appeared with 
great violence. . . .  The numbers affected were very great. . . . A brigade  
of artillery had one-third of its strength taken ill within forty-eight 
hours, and in the brigade ammunition column only ﬁfteen men were 
available for duty one day out of a strength of 145.” The British Third 
Army suffered equally. In June troops returning from the Continent 
introduced the disease into England. 
But again the complications were few and nearly all the troops recov-
ered. The only serious concern—and it was serious indeed—was that the 
disease would undermine the troops’ ability to ﬁght. 
"
"It Begins 
171 
That seemed the case in the German army. German troops in the ﬁeld 
suffered sharp outbreaks beginning in late April. By then German com-
mander Erich von Ludendorff had also begun his last great offensive— 
Germany’s last real chance to win the war. 
The German offensive made great initial gains. From near the front 
lines Harvey Cushing, Halsted’s protégé, recorded the German advance 
in his diary: “They have broken clean through. . . .” “The general situa-
tion is far from reassuring. . . . 11  p.m. The ﬂow of men from the retreat-
ing Front keeps up.” “Haig’s most disquieting Order to the Army . . . ends  
as follows: ‘With our backs to the wall, and believing in the justice of our 
cause, each one of us must ﬁght to the end. The safety of our homes and 
the freedom of mankind depend alike upon the conduct of every one of 
us at this moment.’” 
But then Cushing noted, “The expected third phase of the great Ger-
man offensive gets put off from day to day.” “When the next offensive will 
come off no one knows. It probably won’t be long postponed. I gather 
that the epidemic of grippe which hit us rather hard in Flanders also hit 
the Boche worse, and this may have caused the delay.” 
Ludendorff himself blamed inﬂuenza for the loss of initiative and the 
ultimate failure of the offensive: “It was a grievous business having to lis-
ten every morning to the chiefs of staff’s recital of the number of 
inﬂuenza cases, and their complaints about the weakness of their troops.” 
Inﬂuenza may have crippled his attack, stripped his forces of ﬁghting 
men. Or Ludendorff may have simply seized upon it as an excuse. British, 
French, and American troops were all suffering from the disease them-
selves, and Ludendorff was not one to accept blame when he could place 
it elsewhere. 
In the meantime, in Spain the virus picked up its name. 
Spain actually had few cases before May, but the country was neutral during 
the war. That meant the government did not censor the press, and unlike 
French, German, and British newspapers—which printed nothing negative, 
nothing that might hurt morale—Spanish papers were ﬁlled with reports 
of the disease, especially when King Alphonse XIII fell seriously ill. 
The disease soon became known as “Spanish inﬂuenza” or “Spanish 
flu,” very likely because only Spanish newspapers were publishing accounts 
of the spread of the disease that were picked up in other countries. 
"
"172 
The Great Influenza 
It struck Portugal, then Greece. In June and July, death rates across 
England, Scotland, and Wales surged. In June, Germany suffered initial 
sporadic outbreaks, and then a full-ﬂedged epidemic swept across all the 
country. Denmark and Norway began suffering in July, Holland and Swe-
den in August. 
The earliest cases in Bombay erupted on a transport soon after its 
arrival May 29. First seven police sepoys who worked the docks were 
admitted to the police hospital; then men who worked at the government 
dockyard succumbed; the next day employees of the Bombay port fell ill, 
and two days later men who worked at a location that “abuts on the har-
bor between the government dockyard and Ballard Estate of the Port 
Trust.” From there the disease spread along railroad lines, reaching Cal-
cutta, Madras, and Rangoon after Bombay, while another transport brought 
it to Karachi. 
Inﬂuenza reached Shanghai toward the end of May. Said one 
observer, “It swept over the whole country like a tidal wave.” A reported 
half of Chungking lay ill. It jumped to New Zealand and then Australia in 
September; in Sydney it sickened 30 percent of the population. 
But if it was spreading explosively, it continued to bear little resem-
blance to the violent disease that had killed in Haskell. Of 613 American 
troops admitted to the hospital during one outbreak in France, only one 
man died. In the French army, fewer than one hundred deaths resulted 
from forty thousand hospital admissions. In the British ﬂeet, 10,313 
sailors fell ill, temporarily crippling naval operations, but only four 
sailors died. Troops called it “three-day fever.” In Algeria, Egypt, Tunisia, 
China, and India it was “everywhere of a mild form.” 
In fact, its mildness made some physicians wonder if this disease 
actually was inﬂuenza. One British army report noted that the symptoms 
“resembled inﬂuenza” but “its short duration and absence of complica-
tions” created doubt that it was inﬂuenza. Several different Italian doc-
tors took a stronger position, arguing in separate medical journal articles 
that this “febrile disease now widely prevalent in Italy [is] not inﬂuenza.” 
Three British doctors writing in the journal The Lancet agreed; they con-
cluded that the epidemic could not actually be inﬂuenza, because the 
symptoms, though similar to those of inﬂuenza, were too mild, “of very 
short duration and so far absent of relapses or complications.” 
That issue of The Lancet was dated July 13, 1918.

In March and April in the United States, when the disease began jumping 
from army camp to army camp and occasionally spreading to adjacent 
cities, Gorgas, Welch, Vaughan, and Cole showed little concern about it, 
nor did Avery commence any laboratory investigation. Measles was still 
lingering, and had caused many more deaths. 
But as inﬂuenza surged across Europe, they began to attend to it. 
Despite the articles in medical journals about its generally benign nature, 
they had heard of some worrisome exceptions, some hints that perhaps 
this disease wasn’t always so benign after all, that when the disease did 
strike hard, it was unusually violent—more violent than measles. 
One army report noted “fulminating pneumonia, with wet hemor-
rhagic lungs”—i.e., a rapidly escalating infection and lungs choked with 
blood—“fatal in from 24 to 48 hours.” Such a quick death from pneumo-
nia is extraordinary. And an autopsy of a Chicago civilian victim revealed 
lungs with similar symptoms, symptoms unusual enough to prompt the 
pathologist who performed the autopsy to send tissue samples to Dr. 
Ludwig Hektoen, a highly respected scientist who knew Welch, Flexner, 
and Gorgas well and who headed the John McCormick Memorial Insti-
tute for Infectious Diseases. The pathologist asked Hektoen “to look at it 
as a new disease.” 
And in Louisville, Kentucky, a disturbing anomaly appeared in the in-
fluenza statistics. There deaths were not so few, and—more surprisingly— 
40 percent of those who died were aged twenty to thirty-ﬁve, a statistically 
extraordinary occurrence. 
In France in late May, at one small station of 1,018 French army 
recruits, 688 men were ill enough to be hospitalized and forty-nine died. 
When 5 percent of an entire population—especially of healthy young 
adults—dies in a few weeks, that is frightening. 
By mid-June, Welch, Cole, Gorgas, and others were trying to gather as 
much information as possible about the progression of inﬂuenza in 
Europe. Cole could get nothing from ofﬁcial channels but did learn 
enough from such people as Hans Zinsser, a former (and future) Rocke-
feller investigator in the army in France, to become concerned. In July, 
Cole asked Richard Pearce, a scientist at the National Research Council 
who was coordinating war-related medical research, to make “accurate 
information concerning the inﬂuenza prevailing in Europe” a priority, 
"
"174 
The Great Influenza 
adding, “I have inquired several times in Washington at the Surgeon Gen-
eral’s ofﬁce”—referring to civilian Surgeon General Rupert Blue, head of 
the U.S. Public Health Service, not Gorgas—“but no one seems to have 
any deﬁnite information in regard to the matter.” A few days later Cole 
showed more concern when he advised Pearce to put more resources into 
related research. 
In response Pearce contacted several individual laboratory scientists, 
such as Paul Lewis in Philadelphia, as well as clinicians, pathologists, and 
epidemiologists, asking if they could begin new investigations. He would 
act as a clearinghouse for their ﬁndings. 
Between June 1 and August 1, 200,825 British soldiers in France, out of 
two million, were hit hard enough that they could not report for duty 
even in the midst of desperate combat. Then the disease was gone. On 
August 10, the British command declared the epidemic over. In Britain 
itself on August 20, a medical journal stated that the inﬂuenza epidemic 
“has completely disappeared.” 
The Weekly Bulletin of the Medical Service of the American Expedi-
tionary Force in France was less willing than the British to write off the 
inﬂuenza epidemic entirely. It did say in late July, “The epidemic is about 
at  an  end . . .  and has been throughout of a benign type, though causing 
considerable noneffectiveness.” 
But it went on to note, “Many cases have been mistaken for meningi-
tis. . . . Pneumonias have been more common sequelae in July than in 
April.” 
In the United States, inﬂuenza had neither swept through the country, 
as it had in Western Europe and parts of the Orient, nor had it completely 
died out. 
Individual members of the army’s pneumonia commission had dis-
persed to perform studies in several locations, and they still saw signs of 
it. At Fort Riley, which included Camp Funston, Captain Francis Blake, 
was trying to culture bacteria from the throats of both normal and sick 
troops. It was desultory work, far less exciting than what he was accus-
tomed to, and he hated Kansas. He complained to his wife, “No letter 
from my beloved for two days, no cool days, no cool nights, no drinks, no 
movies, no dances, no club, no pretty women, no shower bath, no poker, 
no people, no fun, no joy, no nothing save heat and blistering sun and 
"

scorching winds and sweat and dust and thirst and long and stiﬂing 
nights and working all hours and lonesomeness and general hell—that’s 
Fort Riley Kansas.” A few weeks later, he said it was so hot they kept their 
cultures of bacteria in an incubator so the heat wouldn’t kill them. 
“Imagine going into an incubator to get cool,” he wrote. 
He also wrote, “Have been busy on the ward all day—some interest-
ing cases. . . . But  most of it inﬂuenza at present.” 
Inﬂuenza was about to become interesting. 
For the virus had not disappeared. It had only gone underground, like 
a forest ﬁre left burning in the roots, swarming and mutating, adapting, 
honing itself, watching and waiting, waiting to burst into ﬂame. 
"

he 1918 influenza pandemic, like many other inﬂuenza pan-
demics, came in waves. The ﬁrst spring wave killed few, but the second 
wave would be lethal. Three hypotheses can explain this phenomenon. 
One is that the mild and deadly diseases were caused by two entirely 
different viruses. This is highly unlikely. Many victims of the ﬁrst wave 
demonstrated signiﬁcant resistance to the second wave, which provides 
strong evidence that the deadly virus was a variant of the mild one. 
The second possibility is that a mild virus caused the spring epidemic, 
and that in Europe it encountered a second inﬂuenza virus. The two 
viruses infected the same cells, “reassorted” their genes, and created a new 
and lethal virus. This could have occurred and might also explain the 
partial immunity some victims of the ﬁrst wave acquired, but at least 
some scientiﬁc evidence directly contradicts this hypothesis, and most 
inﬂuenza experts today do not believe this happened. 
The third explanation involves the adaptation of the virus to man. 
In 1872 the French scientist C. J. Davaine was examining a specimen of 
blood swarming with anthrax. To determine the lethal dose he measured 
out various amounts of this blood and injected it into rabbits. He found 
it required ten drops to kill a rabbit within forty hours. He drew blood 
from this rabbit and infected a second rabbit, which also died. He repeated 
"
"It Begins 
177 
the process, infecting a third rabbit with blood from the second, and so 
on, passing the infection through ﬁve rabbits. 
Each time he determined the minimum amount of blood necessary 
to kill. He discovered that the bacteria increased in virulence each time, 
and after going through ﬁve rabbits a lethal dose fell from 10 drops of 
blood to 1/100 of a drop. At the ﬁfteenth passage, the lethal dose fell to 
1/40,000 of a drop of blood. After twenty-ﬁve passages, the bacteria in the 
blood had become so virulent that less than 1/1,000,000 of a drop killed. 
This virulence disappeared when the culture was stored. It was also 
speciﬁc to a species. Rats and birds survived large doses of the same blood 
that killed rabbits in inﬁnitesimal amounts. 
Davaine’s series of experiments marked the ﬁrst demonstration of a 
phenomenon that became known as “passage.” This phenomenon reﬂects 
an organism’s ability to adapt to its environment. When an organism of 
weak pathogenicity passes from living animal to living animal, it repro-
duces more proﬁciently, growing and spreading more efﬁciently. This 
often increases virulence. 
In other words, it becomes a better and more efﬁcient killer. 
Changing the environment even in a test tube can have the same effect. 
As one investigator noted, a strain of bacteria he was working with turned 
deadly when the medium used to grow the organism changed from beef 
broth to veal broth. 
But the phenomenon is complex. The increase in killing efﬁciency 
does not continue indeﬁnitely. If a pathogen kills too efﬁciently, it will 
run out of hosts and destroy itself. Eventually its virulence stabilizes and 
even recedes. Especially when jumping species, it can become less dan-
gerous instead of more dangerous. This happens with the Ebola virus, 
which does not normally infect humans. Initially Ebola has extremely 
high mortality rates, but after it goes through several generations of human 
passages, it becomes far milder and not particularly threatening. 
So passage can also weaken a pathogen. When Pasteur was trying to 
weaken or, to use his word, “attenuate” the pathogen of swine erysipelas, 
he succeeded only by passing it through rabbits. As the bacteria adapted 
to rabbits, it lost some of its ability to grow in swine. He then inoculated 
pigs with the rabbit-bred bacteria, and their immune systems easily 
destroyed it. Since the antigens on the weak strain were the same as those 
"
"178 
The Great Influenza 
on normal strains, the pigs’ immune systems learned to recognize—and 
destroy—normal strains as well. They became immune to the disease. 
By 1894, veterinarians used Pasteur’s vaccine to protect 100,000 pigs in 
France; in Hungary over 1 million pigs were vaccinated. 
The inﬂuenza virus is no different in its behavior from any other 
pathogen, and it faces the same evolutionary pressures. When the 1918 
virus jumped from animals to people and began to spread, it may have 
suffered a shock of its own as it adapted to a new species. Although it 
always retained hints of virulence, this shock may well have weakened it, 
making it relatively mild; then, as it became better and better at infecting 
its new host, it turned lethal. 
Macfarlane Burnet won his Nobel Prize for work on the immune sys-
tem, but he spent the bulk of his career investigating inﬂuenza, including 
its epidemiological history. He noted an occasion when passage turned a 
harmless inﬂuenza virus into a lethal one. A ship carrying people sick with 
inﬂuenza visited an isolated settlement in east Greenland. Two months 
after the ship’s departure, a severe inﬂuenza epidemic erupted, with a 10 
percent mortality rate; 10 percent of those with the disease died. Burnet 
was “reasonably certain that the epidemic was primarily virus inﬂuenza” 
and concluded that the virus passed through several generations—he 
estimated ﬁfteen or twenty human passages—in mild form before it 
adapted to the new population and became virulent and lethal. 
In his study of the 1918 pandemic, Burnet concluded that by late 
April 1918 “the essential character of the new strain seems to have been 
established.” He continued, “We must suppose that the ancestral virus 
responsible for the spring epidemics in the United States passaged and 
mutated. . . .  The process continued in France.” 
Lethality lay within the genetic possibilities of this virus; this particu-
lar mutant swarm always had the potential to be more pestilential than 
other inﬂuenza viruses. Passage was sharpening its ferocity. As it smol-
dered in the roots, adapting itself, becoming increasingly efﬁcient at 
reproducing itself in humans, passage was forging a killing inferno. 
On June 30, 1918, the British freighter City of Exeter docked at Philadel-
phia after a brief hold at a maritime quarantine station. She was laced 
with deadly disease, but Rupert Blue, the civilian surgeon general and 
"
"It Begins 
179 
head of the U.S. Public Health Service, had issued no instructions to the 
maritime service to hold inﬂuenza-ridden ships. So she was released. 
Nonetheless, the condition of the crew was so frightening that the 
British consul had arranged in advance for the ship to be met at a wharf 
empty of anything except ambulances whose drivers wore surgical 
masks. Dozens of crew members “in a desperate condition” were taken 
immediately to Pennsylvania Hospital where, as a precaution against 
infectious disease, a ward was sealed off for them. Dr. Alfred Stengel, who 
had initially lost a competition for a prestigious professorship at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania to Simon Flexner but who did get it when Flexner 
left, had gone on to become president of the American College of Physi-
cians. An expert on infectious diseases, he personally oversaw the sailors’ 
care. Despite Stengel’s old rivalry with Flexner, he even called in Flexner’s 
protégé Paul Lewis for advice. Nonetheless, one after another, more crew 
members died. 
They seemed to die of pneumonia, but it was a pneumonia accompa-
nied, according to a Penn medical student, by strange symptoms, includ-
ing bleeding from the nose. A report noted, “The opinion was reached 
that they had inﬂuenza.” 
In 1918 all infectious disease was frightening. Americans had already 
learned that “Spanish inﬂuenza” was serious enough that it had slowed 
the German offensive. Rumors now unsettled the city that these deaths 
too came from Spanish inﬂuenza. Those in control of the war’s propa-
ganda machine wanted nothing printed that could hurt morale. Two 
physicians stated ﬂatly to newspapers that the men had not died of 
inﬂuenza. They were lying. 
The disease did not spread. The brief quarantine had held the ship 
long enough that the crew members were no longer contagious when the 
ship docked. This particular virulent virus, ﬁnding no fresh fuel, had 
burned itself out. The city had dodged a bullet. 
By now the virus had undergone numerous passages through hu-
mans. Even while medical journals were commenting on the mild nature 
of the disease, all over the world hints of a malevolent outbreak were 
appearing. 
In London the week of July 8, 287 people died of inﬂuenzal pneumo-
nia, and 126 died in Birmingham. A physician who performed several

autopsies noted, “The lung lesions, complex or variable, struck one as 
being quite different in character to anything one had met with at all 
commonly in the thousands of autopsies one has performed during the 
last twenty years. It was not like the common broncho-pneumonia of 
ordinary years.” 
The U.S. Public Health Service’s weekly Public Health Reports ﬁnally 
took notice, at last deeming the disease serious enough to warn the coun-
try’s public health ofﬁcials that “an outbreak of epidemic inﬂuenza . . .  
has been reported at Birmingham, England. The disease is stated to be 
spreading rapidly and to be present in other locations.” And it warned of 
“fatal cases.” 
Earlier some physicians had insisted that the disease was not in-
ﬂuenza because it was too mild. Now others also began to doubt that 
this disease was inﬂuenza—but this time because it seemed too deadly. 
Lack of oxygen was sometimes so severe that victims were becoming 
cyanotic—part or all of their bodies were turning blue, occasionally a 
very dark blue. 
On August 3 a U.S. Navy intelligence ofﬁcer received a telegram that 
he quickly stamped secret and confidential. Noting that his source was 
“reliable,” he reported, “I am conﬁdentially advised . . . that the disease 
now epidemic throughout Switzerland is what is commonly known as 
the black plague, although it is designated as Spanish sickness and grip.” 
Many histories of the pandemic portray the eruption of deadly disease— 
the hammer blow of the second wave—as sudden and simultaneous in 
widely separated parts of the world, and therefore deeply puzzling. In fact 
the second wave developed gradually. 
When water comes to a boil in a pot, ﬁrst an isolated bubble releases 
from the bottom and rises to the surface. Then another. Then two or 
three simultaneously. Then half a dozen. But unless the heat is turned 
down, soon enough all the water within the pot is in motion, the surface 
a roiling violent chaos. 
In 1918 each initial burst of lethality, isolated though it may have 
seemed, was much like a ﬁrst bubble rising to the surface in a pot coming 
to boil. The ﬂame may have ignited in Haskell and set off the ﬁrst burst. 
The outbreak that killed 5 percent of all French recruits at one small base 
was another. Louisville was still another, as were the deaths on the City of 
"
"It Begins 
181 
Exeter and the outbreak in Switzerland. All these were bursts of lethal dis-
ease, violent bubbles rising to the surface. 
Epidemiological studies written relatively soon after the pandemic 
recognized this. One noted that army cantonments in the United States 
saw “a progressive increase in cases reported as inﬂuenza beginning with 
the week ending August 4, 1918, and of the inﬂuenzal pneumonia cases 
beginning with the week ending August 18. If this was really the begin-
ning of the great epidemic wave we should expect that if these series of data 
were plotted out on a logarithmic scale the increase from week to week 
would plot out as a straight line following the usual logarithmic rise of an 
epidemic curve. . . .  This condition is substantially fulﬁlled with the curve 
of rise plotting out on logarithmic paper as a practically straight line.” 
The report also found “deﬁnite outbreaks of increasing severity” 
occurring during the summer in both the United States and Europe, 
which “indistinguishably blend with the great Fall wave.” 
In early August the crew of a steamship proceeding from France to 
New York was hit so hard with inﬂuenza “that all of the seamen were 
prostrate on it and it had to put into Halifax,” according to an epidemiol-
ogist in Gorgas’s ofﬁce, where it remained until enough crew members 
were well enough to proceed to New York. 
On August 12 the Norwegian freighter Bergensfjord arrived in Brook-
lyn after burying four men at sea, dead of inﬂuenza. It carried two hun-
dred people still sick with the disease; ambulances transported many of 
them to a hospital. 
Royal Copeland, head of the New York City health department, and 
the port health ofﬁcer jointly stated there was “not the slightest danger 
of an epidemic” because the disease seldom attacks “a well-nourished 
people.” (Even had he been right, a study by his own health department 
had just concluded that 20 percent of city schoolchildren were malnour-
ished.) He took no action whatsoever to prevent the spread of infection. 
A navy bulletin warned of two steamships from Norway and one from 
Sweden arriving in New York City with inﬂuenza cases aboard on August 
14 and 15. On August 18, New York papers described outbreaks on board 
the Rochambeau and Nieuw Amsterdam; men from both ships had been 
taken to St. Vincent’s Hospital. 
On August 20 even Copeland conceded that inﬂuenza, though mild 
and—he claimed—certainly not in epidemic form, was present in the city. 
"
"182 
The Great Influenza 
The lethal variant of the virus was ﬁnding its home in humans. Now, 
almost simultaneously, on three continents separated by thousands of 
miles of ocean—in Brest, in Freeport, Sierra Leone, and in Boston—the 
killing, rolling boil was about to begin. 
Nearly 40 percent of the two million American troops who arrived in 
France—791,000 men—disembarked at Brest, a deepwater port capable 
of handling dozens of ships simultaneously. Troops from all over the 
world disembarked there. Brest had already seen a burst of inﬂuenza in 
the spring as had many other cities, albeit as in most of those other places 
that inﬂuenza had been mild. The ﬁrst outbreak with high mortality 
occurred in July, in a replacement detachment of American troops from 
Camp Pike, Arkansas. They occupied an isolated camp and the outbreak 
initially seemed contained. It was not. By August 10, the same day the 
British army declared the inﬂuenza epidemic over, so many French 
sailors stationed at Brest were hospitalized with inﬂuenza and pneumo-
nia that they overwhelmed the naval hospital there—forcing it to close. 
And the death rate among them began soaring. 
The August 19 New York Times took note of another outbreak: “A con-
siderable number of American negroes, who have gone to France on 
horse transports, have contracted Spanish inﬂuenza on shore and died in 
French hospitals of pneumonia.” 
Within another few weeks all the area around Brest was in ﬂames. 
American troops continued pouring into and then out of the city, mixing 
with French troops also training in the vicinity. When soldiers of both 
armies left the vicinity, they dispersed the virus en masse. 
Freetown, Sierra Leone, was a major coaling center on the West African 
coast, servicing ships traveling from Europe to South Africa and the Ori-
ent. On August 15 the HMS Mantua arrived there with two hundred crew 
suffering from inﬂuenza. Sweating black men loaded tons of coal into 
her, guided by several crew. 
When the laborers returned to their homes, they carried more than 
their wages. Soon inﬂuenza spread through the force of men who coaled 
the ships. And this inﬂuenza was not mild. On August 24, two natives 
died of pneumonia while many others were still sick. 
On August 27, the HMS Africa pulled into port. She too needed coal, 
"
"It Begins 
183 
but ﬁve hundred of the six hundred laborers of the Sierra Leone Coaling 
Company did not report to work that day. Her crew helped coal her, 
working side by side with African laborers. She carried a crew of 779. 
Within a few weeks, nearly six hundred were sick. And ﬁfty-one were 
dead—7 percent of the entire crew died. 
The transport HMS Chepstow Castle, carrying troops from New 
Zealand to the front, coaled at Freetown on August 26 and 27; within 
three weeks, out of her 1,150 men, inﬂuenza struck down nine hundred 
of them. The death toll on her was thirty-eight. 
The Tahiti coaled at the same time; sixty-eight men aboard her died 
before she reached England, the same day as the Chepstow Castle. After 
docking, crew of the two ships suffered eight hundred more cases and 
115 more deaths. 
In Sierra Leone itself, ofﬁcials soon after estimated that inﬂuenza 
killed 3 percent of the entire African population, nearly all of them dying 
within the next few weeks. More recent evidence suggests that the death 
toll was most likely considerably more than that, possibly double that 
ﬁgure—or higher. 
Across the Atlantic, at Commonwealth Pier in Boston, the navy operated 
a “receiving ship.” The name was a misnomer. It was actually a barracks 
where as many as seven thousand sailors in transit ate and slept in what 
the navy itself called “grossly overcrowded” quarters. 
On August 27, two sailors reported to sick bay with inﬂuenza. On 
August 28, eight more sailors reported ill. On August 29, ﬁfty-eight men 
were admitted. 
As in Brest and Freetown and aboard ship, men began to die. Fifty of 
the men were quickly transferred to the Chelsea Naval Hospital, where 
Lieutenant Commander Milton Rosenau and his young assistant Lieu-
tenant John J. Keegan, worked. 
The sailors were in better than good hands. While Keegan would later 
become dean of the University of Nebraska Medical School, Rosenau was 
one of the giants of the day. Strong, solid, and thick-necked, he looked as 
intimidating and determined as a wrestler staring down an opponent. Yet 
he was uniformly polite and supportive, and people enjoyed working 
under him. A prime mover in creating the U.S. Public Health Service 
Hygienic Laboratory and later the president of the Society of American

Bacteriologists, he was best known for his textbook, Preventive Medicine 
and Hygiene, which was referred to as “The Bible” for both army and 
navy medical ofﬁcers. Only a few weeks earlier, he had met with Welch, 
Gorgas, and Vaughan to discuss how to prevent or contain any new epi-
demic.* 
Rosenau and Keegan immediately isolated the men and did every-
thing possible to contain the disease, working backward from each victim 
to trace and isolate people with whom the patients had had contact. But 
the disease was too explosive. They turned their attention to bacteriolog-
ical analysis, seeking the pathogen so they could prepare a vaccine or 
serum. Their ﬁndings did not satisfy them, and within a few weeks they 
began using human volunteers from the navy brig in the ﬁrst experi-
ments in the world to determine if a virus caused the disease. 
Long before that any hopes of containing the disease had collapsed. 
On September 3 a civilian suffering from inﬂuenza was admitted to the 
Boston City Hospital. On September 4 students at the Navy Radio School 
at Harvard, in Cambridge across the Charles River from Boston proper, 
fell ill. 
And then came Devens. 
*Rosenau and Flexner had had a running but friendly competition for years. In 
1911 Rosenau had shown that Flexner had made an important mistake. Two years 
later Rosenau won the American Medicine Gold Medal in 1913 for “proving” that sta-
ble ﬂies transmitted poliomyelitis. Flexner proved that ﬁnding to be in error in 1915. 
Yet each respected the other, and they got along well. Shortly before the war, with Har-
vard still underfunding medical research, Flexner wrote him, “I am astonished and 
pained to learn that you have so small a budget for your lab,” and promptly arranged 
for a Rockefeller grant to him. Their cooperation was routine, for example when 
Rosenau asked Flexner earlier in 1918, “Please send Chelsea Naval Hospital at once 
sufﬁcient antimeningitis serum for 4 patients.”

amp Devens sat on ﬁve thousand acres in rolling hills thirty-ﬁve 
miles northwest of Boston. It included ﬁne farmland along the 
Nashua River, as well as what had been until recently heavily forested 
land cut down now to tree stumps. Like the other cantonments in the 
country it was thrown together with amazing speed, at the rate of 10.4 
buildings a day. In August 1917 it opened with ﬁfteen thousand men 
although the camp was incomplete—its sewage was still being discharged 
directly into the Nashua River. 
Like most other camps, it had suffered from measles and pneumonia. 
The medical staff was ﬁrst rate. An inspection of the Devens hospital had 
given it an excellent review down to its kitchen, noting, “The mess ofﬁcer 
is well informed and alert.” 
In fact the Devens medical staff was so good that Frederick Russell 
was preparing to rely on it to launch several major new scientiﬁc inves-
tigations. One involved correlating the existence of streptococci in the 
mouths of healthy soldiers with streptococcal infections of the throat. 
Another sought an explanation for the far higher morbidity rates of 
pneumonia among blacks over whites. Still another involved measles. 
Late in the summer at Devens, Major Andrew Sellards had passed infec-
tious material from a recent measles case through a porcelain ﬁlter to iso-
late the virus, had inoculated four monkeys with it, and on August 29 
began inoculating a series of human volunteers. 
"
"186 
The Great Influenza 
The only problem at Devens was that it was built to hold a maximum 
of thirty-six thousand men. On September 6, Devens held just over forty-
ﬁve thousand men. Still, the camp hospital could accommodate twelve 
hundred and it was caring for only eighty-four patients. With enough 
medical personnel to run several simultaneous research efforts, with a 
highly competent clinical staff, with a virtually empty hospital, Devens 
seemed ready for any emergency. 
It wasn’t. 
A week before any reported illness in the harbor, Boston public health 
authorities worried: “A sudden and very signiﬁcant increase reported the 
third week of August in the cases of pneumonia occurring in the army 
cantonment at Camp Devens in the district seems to justify a suspicion 
that an inﬂuenza epidemic may have started among the soldiers there.” 
While the eruption at Devens might still have come from the Navy 
Commonwealth Pier facility, it might also have developed independently. 
It might even have spread to Boston from Devens. At any rate, on Sep-
tember 1, four more soldiers at Devens were diagnosed with pneumonia 
and admitted to the hospital. In the next six days, twenty-two more new 
cases of pneumonia were diagnosed. None of these, however, were con-
sidered to be inﬂuenza. 
On September 7, a soldier from D Company, Forty-second Infantry, 
was sent to the hospital. He ached to the extent that he screamed when he 
was touched, and he was delirious. He was diagnosed as having meningitis. 
The next day a dozen more men from his company were hospitalized 
and suspected of having meningitis. It was a reasonable diagnosis. Symp-
toms did not resemble those of inﬂuenza, and a few months earlier the 
camp had suffered a minor epidemic of meningitis, and the doctors— 
lacking any false pride—had even called Rosenau for help. He had come 
himself, along with six bacteriologists; they had worked nearly around 
the clock for ﬁve days, identifying and quarantining 179 carriers of the 
disease. Rosenau had left the camp impressed with army medicine; even 
though he and his staff had done much of the work, he had advised navy 
superiors that the same effort would not have been possible in the navy. 
Now, over the next few days, other organizations began reporting 
cases of inﬂuenza-like disease. The medical staff, good as it was, did not

at ﬁrst connect these various cases to each other or to the outbreak on 
Commonwealth Pier. They made no attempt to quarantine cases. In the 
ﬁrst few days no records of inﬂuenza cases were even kept because they 
“were looked upon as being examples of the epidemic disease which 
attacked so many of the camps during the spring.” In the overcrowded 
barracks and mess halls, the men mixed. A day went by. Two days. Then, 
suddenly, noted an army report,“Stated brieﬂy, the inﬂuenza . . . occurred  
as an explosion.” 
It exploded indeed. In a single day, 1,543 Camp Devens soldiers 
reported ill with inﬂuenza. On September 22, 19.6 percent of the entire 
camp was on sick report, and almost 75 percent of those on sick report 
had been hospitalized. By then the pneumonias, and the deaths, had 
begun. 
On September 24 alone, 342 men were diagnosed with pneumonia. 
Devens normally had twenty-ﬁve physicians. Now, as army and civilian 
medical staff poured into the camp, more than two hundred and ﬁfty 
physicians were treating patients. The doctors, the nurses, the orderlies 
went to work at 5:30 a.m. and worked steadily until 9:30 p.m., slept, then 
went at it again. Yet on September 26 the medical staff was so over-
whelmed, with doctors and nurses not only ill but dying, they decided to 
admit no more patients to the hospital, no matter how ill. 
The Red Cross, itself by then overwhelmed by the spread of the dis-
ease to the civilian population, managed to ﬁnd twelve more nurses to 
help and sent them. They were of little help. Eight of the twelve collapsed 
with inﬂuenza; two died. 
For this was no ordinary pneumonia. Dr. Roy Grist, one of the army 
physicians at the hospital, wrote a colleague, “These men start with what 
appears to be an ordinary attack of LaGrippe or Inﬂuenza, and when 
brought to the Hosp. they very rapidly develop the most vicious type of 
Pneumonia that has ever been seen. Two hours after admission they have 
the Mahogany spots over the cheek bones, and a few hours later you can 
begin to see the Cyanosis extending from their ears and spreading all over 
the face, until it is hard to distinguish the coloured men from the white.” 
Blood carrying oxygen in arteries is bright red; without oxygen in 
veins it is blue. Cyanosis occurs when a victim turns blue because the 
lungs cannot transfer oxygen into the blood. In 1918 cyanosis was so 
"
"188 
The Great Influenza 
extreme, turning some victims so dark—the entire body could take on 
color resembling that of the veins on one’s wrists—it sparked rumors 
that the disease was not inﬂuenza at all, but the Black Death. 
Grist continued, “It is only a matter of a few hours then until death 
comes. . . . It is horrible. One can stand it to see one, two or twenty men 
die, but to see these poor devils dropping like ﬂies . . . We have been aver-
aging about 100 deaths per day. . . . Pneumonia means in about all cases 
death. . . . We have  lost an outrageous number of Nurses and Drs., and 
the little town of Ayer is a sight. It takes special trains to carry away the 
dead. For several days there were no cofﬁns and the bodies piled up 
something ﬁerce. . . . It beats any sight they ever had in France after a bat-
tle. An extra long barracks has been vacated for the use of the Morgue, 
and it would make any man sit up and take notice to walk down the long 
lines of dead soldiers all dressed and laid out in double rows. . . . Good By  
old Pal, God be with you till we meet again.” 
Welch, Cole, Victor Vaughan, and Fredrick Russell, all of them colonels 
now, had just ﬁnished a tour of southern army bases. It was not their ﬁrst 
such tour, and as before, knowing that an army barracks offered explosive 
tinder, they had been inspecting camps to ﬁnd and correct any practice 
that might allow an epidemic to gain a foothold. They also spent much 
time discussing pneumonia. After leaving Camp Macon in Georgia, they 
had retired for a few days of relaxation to Asheville, North Carolina, the 
most fashionable summer retreat in the South. The Vanderbilts had built 
one of the most elaborate estates in the country there, and not many 
miles away Welch’s old colleague William Halsted had built a virtual cas-
tle in the mountains (today Halsted’s home is a resort called the High 
Hamptons). 
At the Grove Park Inn, one of the most elegant settings in the city, 
they listened to a concert. Welch lit a cigar. A bellboy promptly told him 
smoking was not allowed. He and Cole withdrew to the veranda and 
began talking. Another bellboy asked them to please be quiet during the 
concert. Welch left in disgust. 
Meanwhile Russell wrote Flexner, “We are all well. Welch, Vaughan, 
and Cole, and I have had a very proﬁtable trip and have begun to believe 
that immunity—” in this he was referring to efforts to manipulate the 
immune system—“is the most important thing in pneumonia, as in 
"
"It Begins

other infectious diseases. It makes a good working hypothesis and one we 
will try to follow up by working in the lab, wards, and in the ﬁeld this fall 
and winter. Bonne chance.” 
The group returned to Washington on a Sunday morning relaxed and 
in good spirits. But their mood changed abruptly as they stepped off the 
train. An escort had been waiting for them and his anxiety quickly com-
municated itself. He was taking them to the surgeon general’s ofﬁce— 
immediately. Gorgas himself was in Europe. His deputy barely looked up 
as they opened the door: “You will proceed immediately to Devens. The 
Spanish inﬂuenza has struck that camp.” 
They arrived at Devens eight hours later in a cold and drizzling rain. The 
entire camp was in chaos, the hospital itself a battleﬁeld. The war had 
come home indeed. As they entered the hospital, they watched a contin-
uous line of men ﬁling in from the barracks carrying their blankets or 
being themselves carried. 
Vaughan recorded this sight: “hundreds of young stalwart men in the 
uniform of their country coming into the wards of the hospital in groups 
of ten or more. They are placed on the cots until every bed is full and yet 
others crowd in. The faces wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings 
up the blood-stained sputum.” 
Care was almost nonexistent. The base hospital, designed for twelve 
hundred, could accommodate at most—even with crowding “beyond 
what is deemed permissible,” according to Welch—twenty-ﬁve hundred. 
It now held in excess of six thousand. All beds had long since been ﬁlled. 
Every corridor, every spare room, every porch was ﬁlled, crammed with 
cots occupied by the sick and dying. There was nothing antiseptic about 
the sight. And there were no nurses. When Welch arrived seventy out of 
two hundred nurses were already sick in bed themselves, with more falling 
ill each hour. Many of them would not recover. A stench ﬁlled the hospi-
tal as well. Bed linen and clothing were rank with urine and feces from 
men incapable of rising or cleaning themselves. 
Blood was everywhere, on linens, clothes, pouring out of some men’s 
nostrils and even ears while others coughed it up. Many of the soldiers, 
boys in their teens, men in their twenties—healthy, normally ruddy men— 
were turning blue. Their color would prove a deadly indicator. 
The sight chilled even Welch and his colleagues. It was more chilling 
"
"190 
The Great Influenza 
still to see corpses littering the hallways surrounding the morgue. 
Vaughan reported, “In the morning the dead bodies are stacked about the 
morgue like cord wood.” As Cole recalled, “They were placed on the ﬂoor 
without any order or system, and we had to step amongst them to get into 
the room where an autopsy was going on.” 
In the autopsy room they saw the most chilling sights yet. On the table 
lay the corpse of a young man, not much more than a boy. When he was 
moved in the slightest degree ﬂuid poured out of his nostrils. His chest 
was opened, his lungs removed, other organs examined carefully. It was 
immediately apparent this was no ordinary pneumonia. Several other 
autopsies yielded similar abnormalities. 
Cole, Vaughan, Russell, the other members of this scientiﬁc team were 
puzzled, and felt an edge of fear. They turned to Welch. 
He had studied with the greatest investigators in the world as a young 
man. He had inspired a generation of brilliant scientists in America. He 
had visited and seen diseases in China, the Philippines, and Japan that 
were unknown in the United States. He had read scientiﬁc journals in 
many languages for years, heard back-channel gossip from all the leading 
laboratories in the world. Surely he would be able to tell them something, 
have some idea. 
He did not reassure. Cole stood beside him, thinking he had never 
seen Welch look nervous before, or excited in quite this way. In fact Cole 
was shaken: “It was not surprising that the rest of us were disturbed but 
it shocked me to ﬁnd that the situation, momentarily at least was too 
much for Dr. Welch.” 
Then Welch said, “This must be some new kind of infection or 
plague.” 
Welch walked out of the autopsy room and made three phone calls, to 
Boston, New York, and Washington. In Boston he spoke to Burt Wolbach, 
a Harvard professor and chief pathologist at the the great Boston hospi-
tal the Brigham, and asked him to perform autopsies. Perhaps there was 
a clue to this strange disease there. 
But Welch also knew that any treatment or prevention for this would 
have to come from the laboratory. From the Rockefeller Institute in New 
York he summoned Oswald Avery. Avery had been refused a commission 
in the Rockefeller army unit because he was Canadian, but on August 1 
"
"It Begins 
191 
he had become an American citizen. By coincidence, the same day Welch 
called him, Avery was promoted from private to captain. More impor-
tantly, he had already begun the investigations that would ultimately rev-
olutionize the biological sciences; inﬂuenza would conﬁrm him in this 
work. 
Later that day both Avery and Wolbach arrived and immediately 
began their respective tasks. 
The third call Welch made was to Washington, to Charles Richard, the 
acting army surgeon general while Gorgas was at the front. Welch gave a 
detailed description of the disease and his expectations of its course at 
Devens and elsewhere. For this was going to spread. He urged that 
“immediate provision be made in every camp for the rapid expansion of 
hospital space.” 
Richard responded instantly, sending orders to all medical personnel 
to isolate and quarantine all cases and segregate soldiers from civilians 
outside the camps: “It is important that the inﬂuenza be kept out of 
the camps, as far as practicable. . . . Epidemics of the disease can often 
be prevented, but once established they cannot well be stopped.” But he 
also conceded the difﬁculty: “There are few diseases as infectious as 
inﬂuenza. . . . It is probable that patients become foci of infection before 
the active symptoms. . . . No  disease which the army surgeon is likely to 
see in this war will tax more severely his judgement and initiative.” 
He also warned both the army adjutant general and chief of staff, 
“New men will almost surely contract the disease. In transferring men 
from Camp Devens a virulent form of the disease will almost surely be 
conveyed to other stations. . . . During the epidemic new men should not 
be sent to Camp Devens, nor should men be sent away from that camp.” 
The next day, with reports already of outbreaks in other camps, 
Richard tried to impress upon the chief of staff the lethality of the dis-
ease, relating what Welch had told him: “The deaths at Camp Devens will 
probably exceed 500. . . .  The experience at Camp Devens may be fairly 
expected to occur at other large cantonments. . . . With few exceptions 
they are densely populated, a condition which tends to increase the chance 
for ‘contact’ infection and the virulence and mortality of the disease. . . .  
It may be expected to travel westward and involve successively military 
stations in its course.” And he urged that the transfer of personnel from 
"
"192 
The Great Influenza 
one camp to another be all but eliminated except for the most “urgent 
military necessities.” 
Gorgas had fought his own war, to prevent epidemic disease from 
erupting in the camps. He had lost. 
On August 27, the same day the ﬁrst sailors at Commonwealth Pier fell ill, 
the steamer Harold Walker had departed Boston, bound for New Orleans. 
En route ﬁfteen crew members had fallen ill; in New Orleans the ship 
unloaded its cargo and put three crewmen ashore. The three men died. 
By then the Harold Walker had proceeded to Mexico. 
On September 4, physicians at the New Orleans naval hospital made 
the ﬁrst diagnosis of inﬂuenza in any military personnel in the city; the 
sailor had arrived in New Orleans from the Northeast. That same date a 
second patient also reported ill with inﬂuenza; he was serving in New 
Orleans. Forty of the next forty-two patients who entered the hospital 
had inﬂuenza or pneumonia. 
On September 7 three hundred sailors from Boston arrived at the 
Philadelphia Navy Yard. Many of them, mixing with hundreds of other 
sailors, were almost immediately transferred to the navy base in Puget 
Sound. Others had already gone from Boston to north of Chicago to the 
Great Lakes Naval Training Station, the largest facility of its kind in the 
world. 
On September 8 at the Newport Naval Base in Rhode Island, more 
than one hundred sailors reported sick. 
The virus was reaching south along the coast, jumping inland to the 
Midwest, spanning the nation to the Paciﬁc. 
Meanwhile, at the Chelsea Naval Hospital, Rosenau and his team of 
physicians were also overwhelmed—and well aware of the larger impli-
cations. Even before Avery arrived, he and Keegan had begun the ﬁrst 
effort in the country, and possibly in the world, to create an immune 
serum that would work against this new mortal enemy. Simultaneously 
Keegan sent off a description of the disease to the Journal of the American 
Medical Association, warning that it “promises to spread rapidly across 
the entire country, attacking between 30 and 40 percent of the popula-
tion, and running an acute course.” 
n

Keegan was incorrect only in that he limited his estimate to “the entire 
country.” He should have said “the entire world.” 
This inﬂuenza virus, this “mutant swarm,” this “quasi species,” had 
always held within itself the potential to kill, and it had killed. Now, all 
over the world, the virus had gone through roughly the same number of 
passages through humans. All over the world, the virus was adapting to 
humans, achieving maximum efﬁciency. And all over the world, the virus 
was turning lethal. 
Around the world from Boston, in Bombay, which like so many other 
cities had endured a mild epidemic in June, the lethal virus exploded 
almost simultaneously. There it quickly began killing at a rate more than 
double that of a serious epidemic of bubonic plague in 1900. 
As the virus moved, two parallel struggles emerged. 
One encompassed all of the nation. Within each city, within each fac-
tory, within each family, into each store, onto each farm, along the length 
of the track of the railroads, along the rivers and roads, deep into the 
bowels of mines and high along the ridges of the mountains, the virus 
would ﬁnd its way. In the next weeks, the virus would test society as a 
whole and each element within it. Society would have to gather itself to 
meet this test, or collapse. 
The other struggle lay within one tight community of scientists. They, 
men like Welch, Flexner, Cole, Avery, Lewis, Rosenau, had been drafted 
against their will into a race. They knew what was required. They knew 
the puzzle they needed to solve. They were not helpless. They had some 
tools with which to work. They knew the cost if they failed. 
But they had very little time indeed.

n September 7, three hundred sailors arrived from Boston at the 
Philadelphia Navy Yard. And what happened in Philadelphia from 
that point would prove—too often—to be a model for what would hap-
pen elsewhere. 
Philadelphia was already typical in its war experiences. Every city was 
being ﬂooded by people, and in Philadelphia shipbuilding alone had 
added tens of thousands of workers. In a few months a great marsh had 
been transformed into the Hog Island shipyard, the largest shipyard in 
the world, where thirty-ﬁve thousand workers toiled among furnaces and 
steel and machinery. Nearby the New York Shipbuilding yard worked 
eleven thousand ﬁve hundred men, and a dozen other shipyards each 
worked from three thousand to ﬁve thousand more. And the city was 
thick with other great industrial plants: several munitions factories each 
employed several thousands at a single location, the J. G. Brill Company 
turned out a streetcar an hour and employed four thousand, Midvale 
Steel had ten thousand workers, Baldwin Locomotive, twenty thousand. 
Overcrowded before the war, with jobs sucking ever more workers 
into the city and the population swelling to 1.75 million, Philadelphia lit-
erally teemed with people. In 1918 a national publication for social work-
ers judged living conditions in its slums, where most tenements still had 
outhouses servicing dozens of families, worse than on the Lower East 
Side of New York. Blacks endured even more squalid conditions and 
"

Philadelphia had the largest African American population of any north-
ern city, including New York or Chicago. 
Housing was so scarce that Boy Scouts canvassed the area seeking 
rooms for newly arrived women with war jobs. Two, three, and four 
entire families would cram themselves into a single two- or three-room 
apartment, with children and teenagers sharing a bed. In rooming houses 
laborers shared not just rooms but beds, often sleeping in shifts just as 
they worked in shifts. In those same tenements, the city’s own health 
department had conceded that during the winter of 1917–18 “the death 
rate . . . has gone up owing to the high cost of living and scarcity of coal.” 
The city offered the poor social services in the form of Philadelphia 
Hospital, known as “Blockley,” a poorhouse, and an asylum. But it offered 
nothing else, not even an orphanage. The social elite and progressives ran 
whatever charitable activities that did exist. Even normal services such as 
schools were in short supply. Of the twenty largest cities in America, 
Philadelphia, the city of Benjamin Franklin and the University of Penn-
sylvania, spent less on education than all but one. In all of South Philadel-
phia, home to hundreds of thousands of Italians and Jews, there would be 
no high school until 1934. 
All this made Philadelphia fertile ground for epidemic disease. So did 
a city government incapable of responding to a crisis. Muckraker Lincoln 
Steffens called Philadelphia “the worst-governed city in America.” He 
may well have been right. 
Even Tammany’s use of power in New York was haphazard compared 
to that of the Philadelphia machine, which had returned to power in 
1916 after a reformer’s single term in ofﬁce. Philadelphia’s boss was 
Republican state senator Edwin Vare. He had bested and mocked people 
who considered themselves his betters, people who despised him, people 
with such names as Wharton, Biddle, and Wanamaker. 
A short, thick-chested, and thick-bellied man—his nickname was 
“the little fellow”—Vare had his base in South Philadelphia. He had 
grown up there before the incursion of immigrants, on a pig farm in a 
then-rural area called “the Neck.” He still lived there despite enormous 
wealth. The wealth came from politics. 
All city workers kicked back a portion of their salary to Vare’s machine. 
To make sure none ever missed a payment, city workers received their 
salary not where they worked or in City Hall—a classic and magniﬁcent 
"

Victorian building, with curved shoulders and windows reminiscent 
of weeping willow trees—but across the street from City Hall in Repub-
lican Party headquarters. The mayor himself kicked back $1,000 from 
his pay. 
Vare was also the city’s biggest contractor, and his biggest contract was 
for street cleaning, a contract he had held for almost twenty years. At a 
time when a family could live in comfort on $3,000 a year, in 1917 he had 
received over $5 million for the job. Not all of that money stayed in Vare’s 
pockets, but even the part that left passed through them and paid a toll. 
Yet the streets were notoriously ﬁlthy, especially in South Philadelphia— 
where the need was greatest, where everything but raw sewage, and 
sometimes even that, ran through the gutters, and where the machine 
was strongest. 
Ironically, the very lack of city services strengthened the machine 
since it provided what the city did not: food baskets to the poor, help with 
jobs and favors, and help with the police—the commissioner and many 
magistrates were in Vare’s pocket. People paid for the favors with votes 
which, like a medieval alchemist, he transmuted into money. 
The machine proved so lucrative that Edwin Vare and his brother 
William, a congressman, became philanthropists, giving so much to their 
church at Moyamensing Avenue and Morris Street that it was renamed the 
Abigail Vare Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church, after their mother. 
Not many churches are named after mere mortals, but this one was. 
Yet nothing about the machine was saintly. On primary election day 
in 1917, several Vare workers blackjacked two leaders of an opposing fac-
tion, then beat to death a policeman who intervened. The incident out-
raged the city. Vare’s chief lieutenant in 1918 was Mayor Thomas B. Smith. 
In his one term in ofﬁce he would be indicted, although acquitted, on 
three entirely unrelated charges, including conspiracy to murder that 
policeman. That same election, however, gave Vare absolute control over 
both the Select and Common Councils, the city’s legislature, and broad 
inﬂuence in the state legislature. 
Director of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and Char-
ities was Dr. Wilmer Krusen, a political appointee who served at the 
mayor’s pleasure and whose term automatically expired with the mayor’s. 
Krusen, a decent man whose son would become a surgeon at the Mayo 
Clinic, was as good an appointment as the machine made. But he lacked 
"
"200 
The Great Influenza 
background in, commitment to, or understanding of public health issues. 
And he was by nature someone who thought most problems disappeared 
on their own. He was not someone to rush into a thing. 
He certainly would exert no pressure whatsoever on the machine to 
advance the public health. Although a gynecologist, he refused even to 
help the military in its massive national campaign against prostitution. 
Even New Orleans had succumbed to pressure to close Storyville, where 
prostitution was legal, but no pressure could make Philadelphia, where 
prostitution remained illegal, in any way hinder its ﬂesh industry. So, 
according to a military report, the navy “actually took control of police 
affairs” outside its installations. 
The city government was choking on corruption, with lines of 
authority split among Vare, precinct captains–turned–entrepreneurs, 
and the mayor. It did not wish to act, nor could it if it chose to. 
Four days after the arrival of the sailors from Boston at the Navy Yard, 
nineteen sailors reported ill with symptoms of inﬂuenza. 
Lieutenant Commander R. W. Plummer, a physician and chief health 
ofﬁcer for the Philadelphia naval district, was well aware of the epi-
demic’s rage on Commonwealth Pier and at Devens and its spread to the 
civilian population in Massachusetts. Determined to contain the out-
break, he ordered the immediate quarantine of the men’s barracks and 
the meticulous disinfecting of everything the men had touched. 
In fact, the virus had already escaped, and not only into the city. One 
day earlier 334 sailors had left Philadelphia for Puget Sound; many would 
arrive there desperately ill. 
Plummer also immediately called in Paul Lewis. 
Lewis had been expecting such a call. 
He loved the laboratory more than he loved anyone or anything, and 
he had the full conﬁdence of Welch, Theobald Smith, and Flexner. Lewis 
had won their conﬁdence by his extraordinary performance as a young 
scientist under each of them in turn. He had already achieved much, and 
he held the promise of much more. He also knew his own worth, not in 
the sense that it made him smug but in that it gave him responsibility, 
making his promise at least as much burden as ambition. Only an offer to 
become the founding head of the new Henry Phipps Institute—Phipps 
had made millions at U.S. Steel with Andrew Carnegie, then, like 
"
"Explosion 
201 
Carnegie, had become a prominent philanthropist—which was associ-
ated with the University of Pennsylvania, had lured him to Philadelphia 
from the Rockefeller Institute. He was modeling Phipps after the insti-
tute, although Phipps would focus much more narrowly on lung disease, 
particularly tuberculosis. 
No one needed to tell Lewis the urgency of the situation. He knew the 
details of the British sailors who had died in early July, and he had very 
likely tried to culture bacteria from them and prepare a serum. Soon after 
learning that inﬂuenza had appeared in the Navy Yard, Lewis arrived there. 
It was up to him to take charge of what would normally be the step-
by-step, deliberate process of tracking down the pathogen and trying to 
develop a serum or vaccine. And there was no time for normal scientiﬁc 
procedures. 
The next day eighty-seven sailors reported ill. By September 15, while 
Lewis and his assistants worked in labs at Penn and at the navy hospital, 
the virus had made six hundred sailors and marines sick enough to require 
hospitalization, and more men were reporting ill every few minutes. The 
navy hospital ran out of beds. The navy began sending ill sailors to the 
Pennsylvania Hospital at Eighth and Spruce. 
On September 17, ﬁve doctors and fourteen nurses in that civilian 
hospital suddenly collapsed. None had exhibited any prior symptoms 
whatsoever. One moment they felt normal; the next, they were being car-
ried in agony to hospital beds. 
Navy personnel from Boston had been transferred elsewhere as well. As 
Philadelphia was erupting, so was the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, 
thirty-two miles above Chicago. Teddy Roosevelt had created the base in 
1905, declaring that it would become the largest and best naval training 
station in the world. With forty-ﬁve thousand sailors it was the largest, 
and it had begun to generate a proud history. The “Seabees” naval con-
struction battalions were born there, and during the war Lieutenant John 
Philip Sousa created fourteen regimental bands there; sometimes all ﬁf-
teen hundred musicians played en masse on Ross Field, spectacle for tens 
of thousands who ﬂocked to hear them. As the inﬂuenza virus swept 
through the base, there would be no massing of anyone, musicians or 
otherwise. At this base, inﬂuenza ripped through the barracks very much 
like an explosion. 
"
"202 
The Great Influenza 
Robert St. John had just been inducted into the navy there when he 
became one of the early victims. Given a cot in a drill hall where soon 
thousands of men—in that one hall—would lie unattended, he later 
recalled, “No one ever took our temperatures and I never even saw a doc-
tor.” He did make his ﬁrst friend in the navy, a boy on the next cot who 
was too ill to reach for water. St. John himself barely had the strength to 
help him drink from his canteen. The next morning an orderly pulled the 
blanket over his friend’s head, and two sailors put the body on a stretcher 
and carried it away. By then the medical department had already reported 
that “33 caskets to Naval Medical Supply Depot required.” They would 
soon require far more than that. 
One nurse at Great Lakes would later be haunted by nightmares. The 
wards had forty-two beds; boys lying on the ﬂoor on stretchers waited for 
the boy on the bed to die. Every morning the ambulances arrived and 
stretcher bearers carried sick sailors in and bodies out. She remembered 
that at the peak of the epidemic the nurses wrapped more than one living 
patient in winding sheets and put toe tags on the boys’ left big toe. It 
saved time, and the nurses were utterly exhausted. The toe tags were ship-
ping tags, listing the sailor’s name, rank, and hometown. She remembered 
bodies “stacked in the morgue from ﬂoor to ceiling like cord wood.” In 
her nightmares she wondered “what it would feel like to be that boy who 
was at the bottom of the cord wood in the morgue.” 
The epidemic was sweeping through the Philadelphia naval installations 
with comparable violence, as it had in Boston. Yet in Philadelphia, despite 
the news out of Boston, despite the Great Lakes situation, despite events 
at its own Navy Yard, Philadelphia public health director Wilmer Krusen 
had done absolutely nothing. 
Not all the city’s public health ﬁgures remained oblivious to the 
threat. The day after the ﬁrst sailor fell ill, Dr. Howard Anders, a promi-
nent public health expert who despised and had no faith in the Vare 
machine, wrote Navy Surgeon General William Braisted to ask would 
“the navy (federal) authorities directly come in, under this threat of 
inﬂuenza invasion, and insist upon safeguarding its men and collaterally 
the whole population of Philadelphia . . . ?”  (Braisted declined.) 
Krusen publicly denied that inﬂuenza posed any threat to the city. He 
seemed to believe that, for he made no contingency plans in case of emer-
"
"Explosion 
203 
gency, stockpiled no supplies, and compiled no lists of medical personnel 
who would be available in an emergency, even though 26 percent of 
Philadelphia’s doctors and even a higher percentage of nurses were in the 
military. Indeed, despite building pressure from Lewis, from Anders, 
from physicians all over the city, from faculty at Penn and Thomas Jeffer-
son Medical College—which refused to release six doctors who wanted to 
volunteer for military service just as the epidemic erupted—not until 
September 18, a full week after the disease appeared in the city, did 
Krusen even schedule a meeting with Plummer, Lewis, and several others. 
In Krusen’s ﬁfth-ﬂoor ofﬁce at City Hall they acquainted each other 
with the facts. In Massachusetts nearly one thousand had already died, 
with tens of thousands ill, and the Massachusetts governor had just 
issued a plea for doctors and nurses from neighboring regions. In Philadel-
phia hundreds of sailors were hospitalized. Few signs of disease had sur-
faced among civilians, but Lewis reported that as yet his research had not 
found an answer. 
Even if Lewis succeeded in making a vaccine, it would take weeks to 
produce in sufﬁcient quantities. Thus, only drastic action could prevent 
the spread of inﬂuenza throughout the city. Banning public meetings, 
closing businesses and schools, imposing an absolute quarantine on the 
Navy Yard and on civilian cases—all these things made sense. A recent 
precedent existed. Only three years earlier Krusen’s predecessor—during 
the single term of the reform mayor—had imposed and enforced a strict 
quarantine when a polio epidemic had erupted, a disease Lewis knew more 
about than anyone in the world. Lewis certainly wanted a quarantine. 
But Plummer was Lewis’s commanding ofﬁcer. He and Krusen 
wanted to wait. Both feared that taking any such steps might cause panic 
and interfere with the war effort. Keeping the public calm was their goal. 
Those polio restrictions had been imposed when the country wasn’t 
ﬁghting a war. 
The meeting ended with nothing decided except to monitor develop-
ments. Krusen did promise to start a mass publicity campaign against 
coughing, spitting, and sneezing. Even that would take days to organize. 
And it would conﬂict with the downplaying of danger by Krusen and 
navy ofﬁcials. 
In Washington, Gorgas, who likely had heard from Lewis, was 
unsatisﬁed with these developments. By then inﬂuenza had erupted in 
"
"204 
The Great Influenza 
two more cantonments, Camp Dix in New Jersey and Camp Meade in 
Maryland, that sandwiched the city. Lewis was in very close contact with 
the Philadelphia Tuberculosis Society, and Gorgas asked it to print and 
distribute twenty thousand large posters warning of inﬂuenza and stat-
ing a simple precaution that might help in at least a small way: “When 
obliged to cough or sneeze, always place a handkerchief, paper napkin, or 
fabric of some kind before the face.” 
Meanwhile the Evening Bulletin assured its readers that inﬂuenza posed 
no danger, was as old as history, and was usually accompanied by a great 
miasma, foul air, and plagues of insects, none of which were occurring 
in Philadelphia. Plummer assured reporters that he and Krusen would 
“conﬁne this disease to its present limits, and in this we are sure to be suc-
cessful. No fatalities have been recorded among Navy men. No concern 
whatever is felt by either the military and naval physicians or by the civil 
authorities.” 
The next day two sailors died of inﬂuenza. Krusen opened the Munic-
ipal Hospital for Contagious Diseases to the navy, and Plummer de-
clared, “The disease has about reached its crest. We believe the situation 
is well in hand. From now on the disease will decrease.” 
Krusen insisted to reporters that the dead were not victims of an epi-
demic; he said that they had died of inﬂuenza but insisted it was only 
“old-fashioned inﬂuenza or grip.” The next day fourteen sailors died. So 
did the ﬁrst civilian, “an unidentiﬁed Italian” at Philadelphia General 
Hospital at South Thirty-fourth and Pine. 
The following day more than twenty victims of the virus went to a 
morgue. One was Emma Snyder. She was a nurse who had cared for the ﬁrst 
sailors to come to Pennsylvania Hospital. She was twenty-three years old. 
Krusen’s public face remained nothing but reassuring. He now conceded 
that there were “a few cases in the civilian population” and said that 
health inspectors were looking for cases among civilians “to nip the epi-
demic in the bud.” But he did not say how. 
On Saturday, September 21, the Board of Health made inﬂuenza a 
“reportable” disease, requiring physicians to notify health ofﬁcials of any 
cases they treated. This would provide information about its movement. 
For the board to act on a Saturday was extraordinary in itself, but the 
"
"Explosion 
205 
board nonetheless assured the city that it was “fully convinced that the 
statement issued by Director Krusen that no epidemic of inﬂuenza pre-
vails in the civil population at the present time is absolutely correct. 
Moreover, the Board feels strongly that if the general public will carefully 
and rigidly observe the recommendations [to] avoid contracting the 
inﬂuenza an epidemic can successfully be prevented.” 
The board’s advice: stay warm, keep the feet dry and the bowels 
open—this last piece of advice a remnant of the Hippocratic tradition. 
The board also advised people to avoid crowds. 
Seven days later, on September 28, a great Liberty Loan parade, 
designed to sell millions of dollars of war bonds, was scheduled. Weeks of 
organizing had gone into the event, and it was to be the greatest parade in 
Philadelphia history, with thousands marching in it and hundreds of 
thousands expected to watch it. 
These were unusual times. The Great War made them so. One cannot 
look at the inﬂuenza pandemic without understanding the context. Wil-
son had realized his aims. The United States was waging total war. 
Already two million U.S. troops were in France; it was expected that at 
least two million more would be needed. Every element of the nation, 
from farmers to elementary school teachers, was willingly or otherwise 
enlisted in the war. To Wilson, to Creel, to his entire administration, and 
for that matter to allies and enemies alike, the control of information 
mattered. Advertising was about to emerge as an industry; J. Walter 
Thompson—his advertising agency was already national, and his deputy 
became a senior Creel aide—was theorizing that it could engineer behav-
ior; after the war the industry would claim the ability to “sway the ideas 
of whole populations,” while Herbert Hoover said, “The world lives by 
phrases” and called public relations “an exact science.” 
Total war requires sacriﬁce and good morale makes sacriﬁces accept-
able, and therefore possible. The sacriﬁces included inconveniences in daily 
life. To contribute to the war effort, citizens across the country endured 
the “meatless days” during the week, the one “wheatless meal” every day. 
All these sacriﬁces were of course voluntary, completely voluntary— 
although Hoover’s Food Administration could effectively close busi-
nesses that did not “voluntarily” cooperate. And if someone chose to go 
"
"206 
The Great Influenza 
for a drive in the country on a “gasless Sunday,” when people were “vol-
untarily” refraining from driving, that someone was pulled over by hos-
tile police. 
The Wilson administration intended to make the nation cohere. Wilson 
informed the head of the Boy Scouts that selling bonds would give “every 
Scout a wonderful opportunity to do his share for the country under the 
slogan, ‘Every Scout to Save a Soldier.’” Creel’s one hundred ﬁfty thou-
sand Four Minute Men, those speakers who opened virtually every pub-
lic gathering including movie and vaudeville shows, inspired giving. And 
when inspiration alone failed, other pressures could be exerted. 
The preservation of morale itself became an aim. For if morale fal-
tered, all else might as well. So free speech trembled. More than in the 
McCarthy period, more than during World War II itself, more than in the 
Civil War—when Lincoln was routinely viliﬁed by opponents—free 
speech trembled indeed. The government had the two hundred thousand 
members of the American Protective League, who reported to the Justice 
Department’s new internal security agency headed by J. Edgar Hoover 
and spied on neighbors and coworkers. Creel’s organization advised citi-
zens, “Call the bluff of anyone who says he has ‘inside information.’ Tell 
him that it’s his patriotic duty to help you ﬁnd the source of what he’s 
saying. If you ﬁnd a disloyal person in your search, give his name to the 
Department of Justice in Washington and tell them where to ﬁnd him.” 
Socialists, German nationals, and especially the radical unionists in 
the International Workers of the World got far worse treatment. The New 
York Times declared, “The IWW agitators are in effect, and perhaps in 
fact, agents of Germany. The Federal authorities should make short work 
of these treasonable conspirators against the United States.” The govern-
ment did just that, raiding union halls, convicting nearly two hundred 
union men at mass trials in Illinois, California, and Oregon, and applying 
relentless pressure against all opponents; in Philadelphia on the same day 
that Krusen ﬁrst discussed inﬂuenza with navy ofﬁcials, ﬁve men who 
worked for the city’s German-language paper Tageblatt were imprisoned. 
What the government didn’t do, vigilantes did. There were the twelve 
hundred IWW members locked in boxcars in Arizona and left on a sid-
ing in the desert. There was IWW member Frank Little, tied to a car and 
dragged through streets in Butte, Montana, until his kneecaps were scraped

off, then hung by the neck from a railroad trestle. There was Robert 
Prager, born in Germany but who had tried to enlist in the navy, attacked 
by a crowd outside St. Louis, beaten, stripped, bound in an American 
ﬂag, and lynched because he uttered a positive word about his country of 
origin. And, after that mob’s leaders were acquitted, there was the juror’s 
shout, “I guess nobody can say we aren’t loyal now!” Meanwhile, a Wash-
ington Post editorial commented, “In spite of excesses such as lynching, it 
is a healthful and wholesome awakening in the interior of the country.” 
Socialist Eugene Debs, who in the 1912 presidential election had 
received nearly one million votes, was sentenced to ten years in prison for 
opposing the war, and in an unrelated trial Wisconsin congressman Vic-
tor Berger was sentenced to twenty years for doing the same. The House 
of Representatives thereupon expelled him and when his constituents 
reelected him anyway the House refused to seat him. All this was to pro-
tect the American way of life. 
Few elites in America enjoyed more luxuries than did Philadelphia 
society, with its Biddles and Whartons. Yet the Philadelphia Inquirer 
reported approvingly that at “a dinner on the Main Line a dozen men 
were gathered at the table, and there was some criticism of the way the 
government was handling things. The host rose and said, ‘Gentlemen, it 
is not my business to tell you what to say but there are four Secret Service 
agents here this evening.’ It was a tactful way of putting a stop to conver-
sation for which he did not care.” 
Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary William McAdoo believed that during 
the Civil War the government had made a “fundamental error” not sell-
ing bonds to average citizens: “Any great war must necessarily be a popu-
lar movement. It is a crusade; and, like all crusades, it sweeps along on a 
powerful stream of romanticism. [Lincoln’s treasury secretary Salmon] 
Chase did not attempt to capitalize the emotions of the people. We went 
direct to the people, and that means to everybody—to businessmen, 
workmen, farmers, bankers, millionaires, schoolteachers, laborers. We 
capitalized on the profound impulse called patriotism. It is the quality of 
coherence that holds a nation together; it is one of the deepest and most 
powerful of human motives.” He went still further and declared, “Every 
person who refuses to subscribe or who takes the attitude of let the other 
fellow do it, is a friend of Germany and I would like nothing better than 
"
"208 
The Great Influenza 
to tell it to him to his face. A man who can’t lend his govt $1.25 a week at 
the rate of 4% interest is not entitled to be an American citizen.” 
The Liberty Loan campaign would raise millions of dollars in Philadel-
phia alone. The city had a quota to meet. Central to meeting that quota 
was the parade scheduled for September 28. 
Several doctors—practicing physicians, public health experts at med-
ical schools, infectious disease experts—urged Krusen to cancel the parade. 
Howard Anders tried to generate public pressure to stop it, telling news-
paper reporters the rally would spread inﬂuenza and kill. No newspaper 
quoted his warning—such a comment might after all hurt morale—so he 
demanded of at least one editor that the paper print his warning that the 
rally would bring together “a ready-made inﬂammable mass for a conﬂa-
gration.” The editor refused. 
Inﬂuenza was a disease spread in crowds. “Avoid crowds” was the 
advice Krusen and the Philadelphia Board of Health gave. To prevent 
crowding the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company had just limited the 
number of passengers in streetcars. 
Army camps had already become so overwhelmed by inﬂuenza that 
on September 26 Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder canceled the next 
scheduled draft call. That same day, Massachusetts governor Samuel 
McCall formally pleaded for federal help and for doctors, nurses, and 
supplies from neighboring states. 
If inﬂuenza was only beginning its assault on Philadelphia, it was 
already roaring full speed through the Navy Yard. Fourteen hundred 
sailors were now hospitalized with the disease. The Red Cross was con-
verting the United Service Center at Twenty-second and Walnut into a 
ﬁve-hundred-bed hospital for the sole use of the navy. Krusen saw those 
reports and heard from those who wanted to cancel the parade, all right, 
but he did not seem to be listening. All he did was forbid the entertain-
ment of soldiers or sailors by any organization or private party in the city. 
But military personnel could still visit stores, ride streetcars, go to vaude-
ville shows or moving picture houses. 
In Philadelphia on September 27, the day before the parade, hospitals 
admitted two hundred more people—123 of them civilians—suffering 
from inﬂuenza. 
Krusen felt intense and increasing pressure to cancel the parade, pres-
"

sure coming from colleagues in medicine, from the news out of Massa-
chusetts, from the fact that the army had canceled the draft. The decision 
whether to proceed or not was likely entirely his own. Had he sought 
guidance from the mayor, he would have found none. For a magistrate 
had just issued an arrest warrant for the mayor, who was now closeted 
with his lawyer, distracted and impossible to reach. Earlier, for the good 
of the city and the war effort, an uneasy truce had been forged between 
the Vare machine and the city’s elite. Now Mrs. Edward Biddle, president 
of the Civic Club, married to a descendant of the founder of the Bank of 
the United States, resigned from a board the mayor had appointed her to, 
ending that truce, adding to the chaos in City Hall. 
Krusen did hear some good news. Paul Lewis believed he was making 
progress in identifying the pathogen, the cause of inﬂuenza. If so, work 
on a serum and a vaccine could proceed rapidly. The press headlined this 
good news, although it did not report that Lewis, a careful scientist, was 
unsure of his ﬁndings. 
Krusen declared that the Liberty Loan parade and associated rallies 
would proceed. 
None of the anxiety of the moment was reported in any of the city’s 
ﬁve daily papers, and if any reporter questioned either Krusen or the 
Board of Health about the wisdom of the parade’s proceeding, no men-
tion of it appeared in print. 
On September 28, marchers in the greatest parade in the city’s history 
proudly stepped forward. The paraders stretched at least two miles, two 
miles of bands, ﬂags, Boy Scouts, women’s auxiliaries, marines, sailors, 
and soldiers. Several hundred thousand people jammed the parade route, 
crushing against each other to get a better look, the ranks behind shout-
ing encouragement over shoulders and past faces to the brave young 
men. It was a grand sight indeed. 
Krusen had assured them they were in no danger. 
The incubation period of inﬂuenza is twenty-four to seventy-two hours. 
Two days after the parade, Krusen issued a somber statement: “The epi-
demic is now present in the civilian population and is assuming the type 
found in naval stations and cantonments.” 
To understand the full meaning of that statement, one must under-
stand precisely what was occurring in the army camps. 
"

evens had been struck by surprise. The other cantonments 
and navy bases were not. Gorgas’s ofﬁce had issued immediate 
warnings of the disease, and medical staffs around the country took heed. 
Even so, the virus reached ﬁrst and with most lethality into these military 
posts, invading the close cluster of young men in their barracks beds. 
Camp Grant was neither the worst hit, nor the least. Indeed, except for 
one particular and individual tragedy, it was quite typical. 
The camp sprawled across rolling but mostly level country on the 
Rock River outside Rockford, Illinois. The soil there was rich and lush, 
and its ﬁrst commandant had planted ﬁfteen hundred acres on the base 
with sweet corn and “hog corn,” hay, wheat and winter wheat, potatoes, 
and oats. Most recruits there came from northern Illinois and Wisconsin, 
farm boys with straw-colored hair and ﬂush cheeks who knew how to 
raise the crops and produced them in plenty. 
It was a remarkably orderly place, given the haste with which it had 
been built. It had neat rows of wooden barracks, and more rows and rows 
of large barrack-tents, eighteen men to each. All the roads were dirt and 
in the late summer dust ﬁlled the air, except when rain turned the roads 
to mud. The hospital was situated at one end of the camp and had two 
thousand beds, although the most patients it had cared for at one time 
was 852; several inﬁrmaries were also scattered throughout the base. 
In June 1918, Welch, Cole, Russell, and Richard Pearce of the National 
"

211 
Research Council—who rarely left Washington, usually being too busy 
coordinating research efforts—had inspected the camp and come away 
impressed. Welch judged Grant’s chief medical ofﬁcer, Lieutenant 
Colonel H. C. Michie, “capable and energetic,” the hospital laboratory 
“excellent,” the pathologist “a good man,” while Joe Capps, a friend of 
Cole, was “of course an excellent chief of service” at the hospital itself. 
The veterinarian, who was responsible for several hundred horses and 
assorted livestock, had also impressed them favorably. 
During that June visit they had all discussed pneumonia. Capps had 
started clinical experiments with a serum developed by Preston Kyes that 
differed from Cole’s. Kyes was a promising University of Chicago investi-
gator of whom Welch had said, “It is worth while for us to keep our eye 
on him.” Capps and Cole exchanged information. Capps also spoke of 
seeing a disturbing trend toward a “different type of pneumonia . . . clin-
ically more toxic and fatal . . . at autopsy often massive areas of consoli-
dation . . . and also areas of hemorrhagic alveoli.” 
Then he demonstrated for them an innovation he had experimented 
with: the wearing of gauze masks by patients with respiratory disease. 
Welch called the mask “a great thing . . . an important contribution in 
prevention of spray infections.” He encouraged Capps to write an article 
for the Journal of the American Medical Association and advised Pearce to 
conduct studies of the masks’ effectiveness. Cole agreed: “This is a very 
important matter in connection with the prevention of pneumonia.” 
Welch also came away from that inspection, the last one of that tour, 
recommending two things. It conﬁrmed in him his desire to have new 
arrivals at all camps assigned for three weeks to specially constructed deten-
tion camps; these men would eat, sleep, drill—and be quarantined— 
together to avoid any cross-infections with men already in camp. Second, 
he wanted Capps’s use of masks extended to all camps. 
Capps did write the JAMA article. He reported ﬁnding the masks so 
successful that after less than three weeks of experimenting he had aban-
doned testing and simply started using them as “a routine measure.” He 
also made the more general point that “one of the most vital measures in 
checking contagion”is eliminating crowding. “Increasing the space between 
beds in barracks, placing the head of one soldier opposite the feet of his 
neighbor, stretching tent ﬂags between beds, and suspending a curtain 
down the center of the mess table, are all of proved value.” 
"
"212 
The Great Influenza 
To prevent a few arriving individuals from infecting an entire camp, 
he also repeated Welch’s recommendation to isolate transferred troops. 
Grant had such a “depot brigade,” a separate quarantine barracks for new 
recruits and transfers. Its stairways were built on the outside so guards 
could enforce the quarantine. But ofﬁcers did not stay in the depot 
brigade; only enlisted men did. 
Capps’s article appeared in the August 10, 1918, issue of JAMA. 
On August 8, Colonel Charles Hagadorn took command of Camp Grant. 
A short, brooding ofﬁcer and a West Point graduate, still a bachelor at 
ﬁfty-one years of age, he had devoted his life to the army and his men. He 
had also prepared for war all his life, studying it constantly and learning 
from experience as well as reading and analysis; one report “accredited 
[him] one of the most brilliant line experts of the regular army.” He had 
fought the Spanish in Cuba, fought guerrillas in the Philippines, and 
chased Pancho Villa in Mexico just a year before. Sometimes he gave what 
seemed impulsive and even inexplicable orders, but they had a curve of 
reason behind them. He was determined to teach his soldiers to survive, 
and to kill. Not to die. He cared about his troops and liked being sur-
rounded by them. 
One problem that confronted him seemed to have little to do with 
war. The camp was over capacity. Only thirty thousand troops had been 
present when Welch had visited in June. Now the strength was in excess 
of forty thousand with no expectation of any decrease. Many men were 
forced into tents and winter—winter in northern Illinois, one year after a 
record cold—was only a few weeks away. 
Army regulations deﬁned how much space each soldier had in the 
barracks. These regulations had little to do with comfort and much to do 
with public health. In mid-September Hagadorn decided to ignore the 
army regulations on overcrowding and move even more men from tents 
into barracks. Already the nights were cold, and they would be more 
comfortable there. 
But by then Gorgas’s ofﬁce had issued warnings about the epidemic 
and inﬂuenza had reached the Great Lakes Naval Training Station one 
hundred miles away. At Camp Grant, doctors watched for the ﬁrst case. 
They even had an idea where it might occur. Dozens of ofﬁcers had just 
arrived from Devens. 
"
"Explosion 
213 
The camp senior medical staff confronted Hagadorn over his plan 
to increase crowding. Although no record exists of the meeting, these 
physicians were men whom Welch and Cole held in the highest regard, 
and in outstanding civilian careers they gave rather than took orders. 
The meeting had to have been contentious. For God’s sake, they would 
have warned him, scattered cases of inﬂuenza had already appeared in 
Rockford. 
But Hagadorn believed that disease could be controlled. In addition 
to his combat record, he had been chief of staff in the Canal Zone and 
had seen Gorgas control even tropical diseases there. Besides, he had 
tremendous conﬁdence in his medical staff. He had more conﬁdence in 
his doctors than they had in themselves, perhaps reminding them they 
had avoided even the measles epidemic that had plagued so many can-
tonments. On September 4 the camp’s own epidemiologist had ﬁled a 
report noting, “The epidemic diseases at this camp were at no time 
alarming. . . . Cases of Measles, Pneumonia, Scarlet fever, Diphtheria, 
Meningitis and the Smallpox occurred sporadically. None of these dis-
eases ever assumed epidemic form.” 
And this was only inﬂuenza. Still, Hagadorn made a few concessions. 
On September 20 he issued several orders to protect the camp’s health. To 
prevent the rise of dust, all roads would be oiled. And out of concern for 
inﬂuenza he agreed to a virtual quarantine: “Until further notice from 
these Headquarters, passes and permission to be absent from Camp . . .  
will not be granted to Ofﬁcers or enlisted men, except from this ofﬁce, 
and then only for the most urgent reasons.” 
But he issued one more order that day as well. It must have been par-
ticularly galling for Michie and Capps to see him use their authority to 
justify it: “There must as a military necessity be a crowding of troops. The 
Camp Surgeon under the circumstances authorizes a crowding in bar-
racks . . . beyond  the authorized capacity. . . . This will be carried out at 
once as buildings are newly occupied.” 
September 21, the day after Hagadorn issued his order, several men in the 
Infantry Central Ofﬁcers Training School—the organization with ofﬁ-
cers from Devens—reported ill. They were immediately isolated in the 
base hospital. 
It did little good. By midnight 108 men from the infantry school and 
"
"214 
The Great Influenza 
the unit next to it were admitted to the hospital. There each patient had a 
gauze mask placed over his mouth and nose. 
The two units were isolated from the rest of the camp, and men in the 
units were partly isolated from each other. Every bed had sheets hung 
around it, and twice a day each man was examined. All public gather-
ings—movies, YMCA functions, and the like—were canceled, and the 
men were ordered not “to mingle in any manner with men of other 
organizations at any time. . . . No visitors will be permitted in the area 
involved. . . . Any barracks from which several  cases are reported will be 
quarantined; its occupants will not be permitted to mingle in any way 
with the occupants of other barracks in the same organization.” 
Guards enforced the orders strictly. But people infected with 
inﬂuenza can infect others before they feel any symptoms. It was already 
too late. Within forty-eight hours every organization in the camp was 
affected. 
The next day hospital admissions rose to 194, the next 371, the next 
492. Four days after the ﬁrst ofﬁcer reported sick, the ﬁrst soldier died. 
The next day two more men died, and 711 soldiers were admitted to the 
hospital. In six days the hospital went from 610 occupied beds to 4,102 
occupied, almost ﬁve times more patients than it had ever cared for. 
There were too few ambulances to carry the sick to the hospital, so 
mules pulled ambulance carts until the mules, exhausted, stopped work-
ing. There were too few sheets for the beds, so the Red Cross ordered six 
thousand from Chicago. There were too few beds, so several thousand 
cots were crammed into every square inch of corridor, storage area, 
meeting room, ofﬁce, and veranda. 
It wasn’t enough. Early on the medical detachment members had 
moved into tents so their own barracks could be transformed into a ﬁve-
hundred-bed—or cot—hospital. Ten barracks scattered throughout the 
camp were also converted into hospitals. It still wasn’t enough. 
All training for war, for killing, ceased. Now men fought to stop the 
killing. 
Healthy soldiers were consumed with attending, in one way or 
another, the sick. Three hundred and twenty men were sent to the hospi-
tal as general support staff, then 260 more were added. Another 250 men 
did nothing but stuff sacks with straw to make mattresses. Several hun-
"
"Explosion 
215 
dred others unloaded a stream of railroad cars full of medical supplies. 
Hundreds more helped transport the sick or cleaned laundry—washing 
sheets, making masks—or prepared food. Meanwhile, barely in advance 
of a threatening thunderstorm, one hundred carpenters worked to enclose 
thirty-nine verandas with rooﬁng paper to keep the rain off the hundreds 
of patients exposed to the elements. The gauze masks Capps was so proud 
of, the masks Welch had praised, were no longer being made; Capps ran 
out of material and personnel to make them. 
The medical staff itself was collapsing from overwork—and disease. 
Five days into the epidemic ﬁve physicians, thirty-ﬁve nurses, and ﬁfty 
orderlies were sick. That number would grow, and the medical staff 
would have its own death toll. 
Seven days into the epidemic soldiers still capable of work converted 
nine more barracks into hospitals. There were shortages of aspirin, 
atropine, digitalis, glacial acetic acid (a disinfectant), paper bags, sputum 
cups, and thermometers—and thermometers that were available were 
being broken by men in delirium. 
Forty more nurses arrived for the emergency, giving the hospital 383. 
It needed still more. All visitors to the base and especially to the hospi-
tal had already been prohibited “except under extraordinary circum-
stances.” Now those extraordinary circumstances had become common, 
with visitors pouring in, Michie noted, “summoned by danger of death 
telegrams. . . .”  Four hundred thirty-eight telegrams had been handled 
the day before. 
That number was still climbing, and rapidly. To handle what soon 
became thousands of telegrams and phone calls each day, the Red Cross 
erected a large tent, ﬂoored, heated, wired for electricity, with its own 
telephone exchange and rows of chairs that resembled an auditorium 
where relatives waited to see desperately ill soldiers. More personnel were 
needed to escort these visitors to the sick. More personnel and more 
laundry facilities were needed just to wash the gown and mask that every 
visitor donned. 
The hospital staff could not keep pace. Endless rows of men cough-
ing, lying in bloodstained linen, surrounded by ﬂies—orders were issued 
that “formalin should be added to each sputum cup to keep the ﬂies 
away”—and the grotesque smells of vomit, urine, and feces made the 
relatives in some ways more desperate than the patients. They offered bribes 
"
"216 
The Great Influenza 
to whoever seemed healthy—doctor, nurse, or orderly—to ensure care 
for their sons and lovers. Indeed, visitors begged them to accept bribes. 
Michie responded sternly: “Devoting special personal care to any one 
patient whose condition is not critical is prohibited and the ward per-
sonnel is instructed to report any civilian or other person to the com-
manding ofﬁcer who makes a special request that a certain patient be 
given special attention.” 
And there was something else, something still worse. 
The same day that the ﬁrst Camp Grant soldier died, 3,108 troops boarded 
a train leaving there for Camp Hancock outside Augusta, Georgia. 
They left as a civilian health ofﬁcial several hundred miles away from 
Camp Grant demanded the quarantine of the entire camp, demanded 
that even escorts of the dead home be prohibited. They left with the 
memory of the trains carrying troops infected with measles, when Gor-
gas and Vaughan had protested uselessly that troops had “distributed its 
seeds at the encampment and on the train. No power on earth could stop 
the spread of measles under these conditions.” They left after the provost 
general had had the foresight to cancel the next draft. And they left after 
Gorgas’s ofﬁce had urged that all movement of troops between infected 
and uninfected camps cease. 
The army did order no “transfer of any inﬂuenza contacts” between 
camps or to bases under quarantine. But even that order came days later, 
at a time when each day’s delay could cost literally thousands of lives. And 
the order also stated that “movements of ofﬁcers and men not contacts 
will be effected promptly as ordered.” Yet men could appear healthy while 
incubating inﬂuenza themselves, and they could also infect others before 
symptoms appeared. 
The men leaving Grant on that train were jammed into the cars with 
little room to move about, layered and stacked as tightly as if on a sub-
marine as they moved deliberately across 950 miles of the country. They 
would have been excited at ﬁrst, for movement creates its own excite-
ment, and then tedium would have set in, the minutes dragging out, the 
hours melding the passage into a self-contained world ten feet across and 
seven feet high, smelling of cigarette smoke and sweat, with hundreds of 
men in each car in far closer quarters than in any barracks, and with far 
less ventilation. 
"
"Explosion 
217 
As the country rolled by men would have leaned out windows to suck 
in a wisp of air the way they sucked on cigarettes. And then one soldier 
would have broken into a coughing ﬁt, another would have begun pour-
ing out sweat, another would have suddenly had blood pouring out of his 
nose. Other men would have shrunk from them in fear, and then still oth-
ers would have collapsed or erupted in fever or delirium or begun bleed-
ing from their nose or possibly their ears. The train would have ﬁlled 
with panic. At stops for refueling and watering, men would have poured 
out of the train seeking any escape, mixed with workers and other civil-
ians, obeyed reluctantly when ofﬁcers ordered them back into the cars, 
into this rolling cofﬁn. 
When the train arrived, over seven hundred men—nearly one-quarter 
of all the troops on the train—were taken directly to the base hospital, 
quickly followed by hundreds more; in total, two thousand of the 3,108 
troops would be hospitalized with inﬂuenza. After 143 deaths among 
them the statistics merged into those of other troops from Camp Han-
cock—Hancock, to which this shipment of virus was sent—and became 
impossible to track. But it is likely that the death toll approached, and 
possibly exceeded, 10 percent of all the troops on the train. 
Hagadorn had become all but irrelevant to the running of the camp. Now 
he yielded on every point to the medical personnel, did everything they 
asked, made every resource available to them. Nothing seemed even to 
slow the disease. 
On October 4, for the ﬁrst time more than one hundred men at Camp 
Grant died in a single day. Nearly ﬁve thousand were ill, with hundreds 
more falling ill each day. And the graph of contagion still pointed nearly 
straight up. 
Soon, in a single day, 1,810 soldiers would report ill. At some other 
army camps even more soldiers would collapse almost simultaneously; 
indeed, at Camp Custer outside Battle Creek, Michigan, twenty-eight 
hundred troops would report ill—in a single day. 
Before the epidemic, Capps had begun testing Preston Kyes’s pneu-
monia serum, prepared from chickens. Kyes had reasoned that since 
chickens were not susceptible to the pneumococcus, infecting them with 
highly virulent pneumococci might produce a very powerful serum. 
Capps had planned a series of “very carefully controlled” experiments. 
"
"218 
The Great Influenza 
But now, with nothing else to try, he administered the serum to all as it 
arrived—it was in short supply. It seemed to work. Two hundred and 
thirty-four men suffering from pneumonia received the serum; only 16.7 
percent died, while more than half of those who did not receive it died. 
But it was in short supply. 
Desperate efforts were being made to protect troops from the disease, 
or at least prevent complications. Germicidal solutions were sprayed into 
the mouths and noses of troops. Soldiers were ordered to use germicidal 
mouthwash and to gargle twice a day. Iodine in glycerine was tried in an 
attempt disinfect mouths. Vaseline containing menthol was used in nasal 
passages, mouths washed with liquid albolene. 
Despite every effort, the death toll kept rising. It rose so high that 
staff grew weary, weary of paperwork, weary even of identifying the 
dead. Michie was forced to issue orders warning, “The remains are 
labeled by placing an adhesive plaster bearing the name, rank, organiza-
tion around the middle of the left forearm. It is the duty of the Ward Sur-
geon to see that this is done before the remains leave the ward. . . . A great  
deal of difﬁculty has been experienced in reading names on death certiﬁ-
cates . . . Either have these certiﬁcates typewritten or . . . plainly printed. 
Any neglect on the part of responsible persons will be interpreted as a 
neglect of duty.” 
Michie also instructed all personnel,“The relatives and friends of per-
sons dying at this hospital must not be sent to the base hospital 
morgue. . . .  The handling of the effects of the deceased has grown into 
an enormous task.” 
Simultaneously, in that important ﬁght to sustain the country’s 
morale, the Chicago Tribune reported good news from Camp Grant. 
“Epidemic Broken!” blared the paper’s headlines. “The small army of 
expert workers under the command of Lt. Col. H. C. Michie has battled 
the pneumonia epidemic to a standstill . . . deaths occurred among the 
pneumonia patients, but more than 100 ﬁghting men pulled through the 
crisis of their illness . . .  175 patients have been released after winning 
their ﬁght.” 
At that point Grant’s death toll was 452. It showed no sign of slowing. 
Hoping to have some slight effect on it, hoping to prevent cross-infections, 
Michie and Capps reiterated their orders to place patients outside: “The 
"
"Explosion 
219 
crowding of patients in the wards must be reduced to the minimum. . . .  
The verandas must be used to the greatest advantage.” 
Perhaps that reminded Hagadorn of his earlier order authorizing over-
crowding. Perhaps then too he got word of the hundreds of young men 
who had died on the train to Georgia, which, like the barracks overcrowd-
ing, he had ordered because of “military necessity.” Perhaps these things 
caused him such personal pain that it explained why he abruptly ordered 
the withholding of the names of all soldiers who died from inﬂuenza. 
Perhaps somehow that allowed him to block the deaths from his mind. 
A day later the death toll at the camp broke ﬁve hundred, with thou-
sands more still desperately ill. “How far the pandemic will spread will 
apparently depend only upon the material which it can feed upon,” wrote 
one army physician. “It is too early to foretell the end or to measure the 
damage which will be done before the pandemic disappears.” 
Many of the dead were more boys than men, eighteen years old, nine-
teen years old, twenty years old, twenty-one years old, boys ﬁlled with 
their lithe youth and sly smiles. Hagadorn, the bachelor, had made the 
army his home, his soldiers his family, the young men about him his life. 
On October 8 Michie reported the latest death toll to Colonel 
Hagadorn in his headquarters ofﬁce. The colonel heard the report, nod-
ded, and, after an awkward moment, Michie rose to leave. Hagadorn told 
him to close the door. 
Death was all about him, in the papers on his desk, in the reports he 
heard, literally in the air he breathed. It was an envelope sealing him in. 
He picked up his phone and ordered his sergeant to leave the building 
and take with him all personnel in the headquarters and stand for inspec-
tion outside. 
It was a bizarre order. The sergeant informed Captain Jisson and 
Lieutenant Rashel. They were puzzled but complied. 
For half an hour they waited. The pistol shot, even from inside the 
building, came as a loud report. 
Hagadorn was not listed as a casualty of the epidemic. Nor did his sac-
riﬁce stop it. 
"
"C H A P T E R  N I N E T E E N

wo days after Philadelphia’s Liberty Loan parade, Wilmer Krusen 
had issued that somber statement, that the epidemic in the civilian 
population “was assuming the type found in naval stations and canton-
ments.” 
Inﬂuenza was indeed exploding in the city. Within seventy-two hours 
after the parade, every single bed in each of the city’s thirty-one hospitals 
was ﬁlled. And people began dying. Hospitals began refusing to accept 
patients—with nurses turning down $100 bribes—without a doctor’s or 
a police order. Yet people queued up to get in. One woman remembered 
her neighbors going “to the closest hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital at 
5th and Lombard but when they got there there were lines and no doc-
tors available and no medicine available. So they went home, those that 
were strong enough.” 
Medical care was making little difference anyway. Mary Tullidge, 
daughter of Dr. George Tullidge, died twenty-four hours after her ﬁrst 
symptoms. Alice Wolowitz, a student nurse at Mount Sinai Hospital, 
began her shift in the morning, felt sick, and was dead twelve hours later. 
On October 1, the third day after the parade, the epidemic killed more 
than one hundred people—117—in a single day. That number would 
double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple. Soon the daily death toll 
from inﬂuenza alone would exceed the city’s average weekly death toll 
from all causes—all illnesses, all accidents, all criminal acts combined. 
"
"Explosion 
221 
On October 3, only ﬁve days after Krusen had let the parade proceed, 
he banned all public meetings in the city—including, ﬁnally, further Lib-
erty Loan gatherings—and closed all churches, schools, theaters. Even 
public funerals were prohibited. Only one public gathering place was 
allowed to remain open: the saloon, the key constituency of the Vare 
machine. The next day the state health commissioner closed them. 
The ﬁrst temporary facility to care for the sick was set up at Holmes-
burg, the city’s poorhouse. It was called “Emergency Hospital #1”; the 
Board of Health knew more would follow. Its ﬁve hundred beds were 
ﬁlled in a day. Ultimately there would be twelve similar large hospitals 
run with city help, three of them located in converted Republican Clubs 
in South Philadelphia. It was where people had always gone for help. 
In ten days—ten days!—the epidemic had exploded from a few hun-
dred civilian cases and one or two deaths a day to hundreds of thousands 
ill and hundreds of deaths each day. 
Federal, municipal, and state courts closed. Giant placards every-
where warned the public to avoid crowds and use handkerchiefs when 
sneezing or coughing. Other placards read “Spitting equals death.” People 
who spat on the street were arrested—sixty in a single day. The newspa-
pers reported the arrests—even while continuing to minimize the epi-
demic. Physicians were themselves dying, three one day, two another, 
four the next. The newspapers reported those deaths—on inside pages 
with other obituaries—even while continuing to minimize the epidemic. 
Health and city workers wore masks constantly. 
What should I do? people wondered, with dread. How long will it go 
on? Each day people discovered that friends and neighbors who had been 
perfectly healthy a week—or a day—earlier were dead. 
And city authorities and newspapers continued to minimize the dan-
ger. The Public Ledger claimed nonsensically that Krusen’s order banning 
all public gatherings was not “a public health measure” and reiterated, 
“There is no cause for panic or alarm.” 
On October 5, doctors reported that 254 people died that day from 
the epidemic, and the papers quoted public health authorities as saying, 
“The peak of the inﬂuenza epidemic has been reached.” When 289 
Philadelphians died the next day, the papers said, “Believing that the peak 
of the epidemic has passed, health ofﬁcials are conﬁdent.” 
In each of the next two days more than three hundred people died, 
"
"222 
The Great Influenza 
and again Krusen announced, “These deaths mark the high water mark 
in the fatalities, and it is fair to assume that from this time until the epi-
demic is crushed the death rate will constantly be lowered.” 
The next day 428 people died, and the daily death toll would keep 
climbing for many days yet—approaching double even that ﬁgure. 
Krusen said, “Don’t get frightened or panic stricken over exaggerated 
reports.” 
But Krusen’s reassurances no longer reassured. 
One could not listen to Paul Lewis speak on any subject and not sense the 
depth of his knowledge and his ability to see into a problem, envision 
possible solutions and understand their ramiﬁcations. Other scientists in 
the city did not defer to him, but they looked to him. 
He had been working on this problem for three weeks now. He hardly 
ever left his laboratory. Nor did his assistants, except for the ones who fell 
ill. Every scientist in Philadelphia was spending every waking minute in 
the laboratory as well. 
The laboratory was his favorite place anyway, more even than home. 
Normally, everything in his work gave him peace; the laboratory gave 
him peace, including the mysteries that he embraced. He settled into them 
like a man casting off into an impenetrable ocean fog, a fog that made 
one feel both alone in and part of the world. 
But this work did not give him peace. It wasn’t the pressure exactly. It 
was that the pressure forced him off rhythm, forced him to abandon the 
scientiﬁc process. He developed a hypothesis and focused on it, but the 
shorthand process by which he arrived at it made him uncomfortable. 
So did hearing the news of the deaths. The youth and vitality and 
promise of the dead horriﬁed. The waste of their promise horriﬁed. He 
worked harder. 
Arthur Eissinger, president and “honor man” of Penn’s class of 1918, 
died. Dudley Perkins, a Swarthmore football hero, died. Nearly two-
thirds of the dead were under forty. 
It was a common practice in 1918 for people to hang a piece of crepe 
on the door to mark a death in the house. There was crepe everywhere. “If 
it was a young person they’d put a white crepe at the door,” recalled Anna 
Milani. “If it was a middle-aged person, they’d put a black crepe, and if it 
"
"Explosion 
223 
was an elderly one, they put a grey crepe at the door signiﬁying who died. 
We were children and we were excited to ﬁnd out who died next and we 
were looking at the door, there was another crepe and another door.” 
There was always another door. “People were dying like ﬂies,” Clifford 
Adams said. “On Spring Garden Street, looked like every other house had 
crepe over the door. People was dead there.” 
Anna Lavin was at Mount Sinai Hospital: “My uncle died there. . . .  
My aunt died ﬁrst. Their son was thirteen. . . . A  lot of young people, just 
married, they were the ﬁrst to die.” 
But the most terrifying aspect of the epidemic was the piling up of 
bodies. Undertakers, themselves sick, were overwhelmed. They had no 
place to put bodies. Gravediggers either were sick or refused to bury 
inﬂuenza victims. The director of the city jail offered to have prisoners 
dig graves, then rescinded the offer because he had no healthy guards to 
watch them. With no gravediggers bodies could not be buried. Undertak-
ers’ work areas were overﬂowing, they stacked caskets in halls, in their liv-
ing quarters—many lived above their businesses. 
Then undertakers ran short of cofﬁns. The few cofﬁns available sud-
denly became priceless. Michael Donohue’s family operated a funeral 
home: “We had caskets stacked up outside the funeral home. We had to 
have guards kept on them because people were stealing the caskets. . . .  
You’d equate that to grave robbing.” 
There were soon no caskets left to steal. Louise Apuchase remembered 
most vividly the lack of cofﬁns: “A neighbor boy about seven or eight 
died and they used to just pick you up and wrap you up in a sheet and put 
you in a patrol wagon. So the mother and father screaming, ‘Let me get a 
macaroni box’ [for a cofﬁn]—macaroni, any kind of pasta, used to come 
in this box, about 20 pounds of macaroni ﬁt in it—‘please please let me 
put him in the macaroni box, don’t take him away like that. . . .’”  
Clifford Adams remembered “bodies stacked up . . .  stacked up out to 
be  buried. . . . They couldn’t bury them.” The bodies backed up more and 
more, backed up in the houses, were put outside on porches. 
The city morgue had room for thirty-six bodies. Two hundred were 
stacked there. The stench was terrible; doors and windows were thrown 
open. No more bodies could ﬁt. Bodies lay in homes where they died, as 
they died, often with bloody liquid seeping from the nostrils or mouths. 
Families covered the bodies in ice; even so the bodies began to putrefy 
"
"224 
The Great Influenza 
and stink. Tenements had no porches; few had ﬁre escapes. Families 
closed off rooms where a body lay, but a closed door could not close out 
the knowledge and the horror of what lay behind the door. In much of 
the city, a city more short of housing than New York, people had no room 
that could be closed off. Corpses were wrapped in sheets, pushed into 
corners, left there sometimes for days, the horror of it sinking in deeper 
each hour, people too sick to cook for themselves, too sick to clean them-
selves, too sick to move the corpse off the bed, lying alive on the same bed 
with the corpse. The dead lay there for days, while the living lived with 
them, were horriﬁed by them, and, perhaps most horribly, became accus-
tomed to them. 
Symptoms were terrifying. Blood poured from noses, ears, eye sock-
ets; some victims lay in agony; delirium took others away while living. 
Routinely two people in a single family would die. Three deaths in a 
family were not uncommon. Sometimes a family suffered even more. 
David Sword lived at 2802 Jackson Street. On October 5 the sixth mem-
ber of his family died of inﬂuenza, while the North American reported 
that three other family members in the hospital “may also die of the 
plague.” 
The plague. In the streets people had been whispering the word. The 
word slipped, somehow, once, by accident, into that newspaper. The 
“morale” issue, the self-censorship, the intent by editors to put every 
piece of news in the most positive possible context, all meant that no 
newspaper used that word again. Yet people did not need newspapers to 
speak of the Black Death. Some bodies were turning almost black. People 
had seen them, and they had lost faith in what they read anyway. One 
young medical student called in to treat hundreds of patients recalled, 
“The cyanosis reached an intensity that I have never seen since. Indeed 
the rumor got about that the Black Death had returned.” The newspapers 
quoted Dr. Raymond Leopold, sounding reasonable: “There is abundant 
reason  for  such  a  rumor. . . . It is true  that many bodies have assumed a 
dark hue and have given off a pronounced odor after death.” But he gave 
his assurance, “There is no truth in the black plague assertion.” 
He was of course correct. But how many trusted the newspapers any-
more? And even if the Black Death had not come, a plague had and, with 
it, so had terror. 
The war had come home.

Long before Hagadorn’s suicide, long before the marchers in Philadel-
phia began to parade down the city streets, inﬂuenza had seeded itself 
along the edges of the nation. 
On September 4 it had reached New Orleans, with the three sea-
men—who soon died—carried to the hospital off the Harold Walker 
from Boston. On September 7 it had reached the Great Lakes Naval 
Training Station, with sailors transferred from Boston. In the next few 
days ports and naval facilities on the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts—in New-
port, New London, Norfolk, Mobile, and Biloxi—also reported this new 
inﬂuenza. On September 17, 1918, “the extensive prevalence of an 
inﬂuenza-like disease” was reported in Petersburg, Virginia, outside 
Camp Lee. That same day, the several hundred sailors who had departed 
Philadelphia earlier for Puget Sound arrived; eleven men had to be car-
ried from the ship on stretchers to a hospital, bringing the new virus to 
the Paciﬁc. 
The virus had spanned the country, establishing itself on the Atlantic, 
in the Gulf, on the Paciﬁc, on the Great Lakes. It had not immediately 
erupted in epidemic form, but it had seeded itself. Then the seeds began 
to sprout into ﬂowers of ﬂame. 
The virus followed rail and river into the interior of the continent, 
from New Orleans up the Mississippi River into the body of the nation, 
from Seattle to the East, from the Great Lakes training station to Chicago 
and from there along the railroad lines in many directions. From each 
original locus ﬁngers reached out, unevenly, like sparks shooting out, 
often jumping over closer points to farther ones—from Boston to New-
port, for example, and only then reaching backward to ﬁll in Brockton 
and Providence and places in between. 
On September 28, when the Liberty Loan paraders marched through 
Philadelphia streets, there were as yet only seven cases reported in Los 
Angeles, two in San Francisco. But the virus would get there soon enough. 
In Philadelphia meanwhile fear came and stayed. Death could come 
from anyone, anytime. People moved away from others on the sidewalk, 
avoided conversation; if they did speak, they turned their faces away to 
avoid the other person’s breathing. People became isolated, increasing 
the fear. 
"
"226 
The Great Influenza 
The impossibility of getting help compounded the isolation. Eight 
hundred ﬁfty Philadelphia doctors and more nurses were away in the 
military. More than that number were sick. Philadelphia General Hospi-
tal had 126 nurses. Despite all precautions, despite wearing surgical 
masks and gowns, eight doctors and ﬁfty-four nurses—43 percent of the 
staff—themselves required hospitalization. Ten nurses at this single hos-
pital died. The Board of Health pleaded for help from retired nurses and 
doctors if they remembered “even a little” of their profession. 
When a nurse or doctor or policeman did actually come, they wore 
their ghostly surgical masks, and people ﬂed them. In every home where 
someone was ill, people wondered if the person would die. And someone 
was ill in every home. 
Philadelphia had ﬁve medical schools. Each one dismissed its classes, 
and third- and fourth-year students manned emergency hospitals being 
set up in schools and empty buildings all over the city. The Philadelphia 
College of Pharmacy closed as well, sending its students out to help drug-
gists. 
Before University of Pennsylvania medical students went out to man 
the hospitals, they listened to a lecture from Alfred Stengel, the expert on 
infectious diseases who had treated the crew of the City of Exeter what 
seemed so long ago. Stengel reviewed dozens of ideas that had been 
advanced in medical journals. Gargles of various disinfectants. Drugs. 
Immune sera. Typhoid vaccine. Diphtheria antitoxin. But Stengel’s mes-
sage was simple: This doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. Nothing worked. 
“His suggestion for treatment was negative,” Isaac Starr, one of those 
Penn students, who became an internationally known cardiologist, re-
called. “He had no conﬁdence in any of the remedies that had been pro-
posed.” 
Stengel was correct. Nothing they were yet doing worked. Starr went 
to Emergency Hospital #2 at Eighteenth and Cherry Streets. He did have 
help, if it could be called that, from an elderly physician who had not 
practiced in years and who brought Starr into touch with the worst of 
heroic medicine. Starr wouldn’t forget that, the ancient arts of purging, 
of venesection, the ancient art of opening a patient’s vein. But for the 
most part he and the other students elsewhere were on their own, with 
little help even from nurses, who were so desperately needed that in each 
of ten emergency hospitals supplied by the Red Cross only a single qual-
"
"Explosion 
227 
iﬁed nurse was available to oversee whatever women came as volunteers. 
And often the volunteers reported for their duty once and, from either 
fear or exhaustion, did not come again. 
Starr had charge of an entire ﬂoor of an emergency hospital. He 
thought at ﬁrst his patients had “what appeared to be a minor illness . . .  
with fever but little else. Unhappily the clinical features of many soon 
changed.” Most striking again was the cyanosis, his patients sometimes 
turning almost black. “After gasping for several hours they became deliri-
ous and incontinent, and many died struggling to clear their airways of a 
blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth.” 
Nearly one-quarter of all the patients in his hospital died each day. 
Starr would go home, and when he returned the next day, he would ﬁnd 
that between one-quarter and one-ﬁfth of the patients in the hospital had 
died, replaced by new ones. 
Literally hundreds of thousands of people in Philadelphia were falling 
ill. Virtually all of them, along with their friends and relatives, were terri-
ﬁed that, no matter how mild the symptoms seemed at ﬁrst, within them 
moved an alien force, a seething, spreading infection, a live thing with a 
will that was taking over their bodies—and could be killing them. And 
those who moved about them feared—feared both for the victims and 
for themselves. 
The city was frozen with fear, frozen quite literally into stillness. Starr 
lived twelve miles from the hospital, in Chestnut Hill. The streets were 
silent on his drive home, silent. They were so silent he took to counting 
the cars he saw. One night he saw no cars at all. He thought, “The life of 
the city had almost stopped.”

his was influenza, only inﬂuenza. 
This new inﬂuenza virus, like most new inﬂuenza viruses, spread 
rapidly and widely. As a modern epidemiologist already quoted has 
observed, Inﬂuenza is a special instance among infectious diseases. This virus 
is transmitted so effectively that it exhausts the supply of susceptible hosts. 
This meant that the virus sickened tens of millions of people in the United 
States—in many cities more than half of all families had at least one vic-
tim ill with inﬂuenza; in San Antonio the virus made more than half the 
entire population ill—and hundreds of millions across the world. 
But this was inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza. The overwhelming majority of 
victims got well. They endured, sometimes a mild attack and sometimes 
a severe one, and they recovered. 
The virus passed through this vast majority in the same way inﬂuenza 
viruses usually did. Victims had an extremely unpleasant several days 
(the unpleasantness multiplied by terror that they would develop serious 
complications) and then recovered within ten days. The course of the dis-
ease in these millions actually convinced the medical profession that this 
was indeed only inﬂuenza. 
But in a minority of cases, and not just in a tiny minority, the virus 
manifested itself in an inﬂuenza that did not follow normal patterns, that 
was unlike any inﬂuenza ever reported, that followed a course so differ-
ent from the usual one for the disease that Welch himself had initially 
"
"232 
The Great Influenza 
feared some new kind of infection or plague. If Welch feared it, those who 
suffered with the disease were terriﬁed by it. 
Generally in the Western world, the virus demonstrated extreme vir-
ulence or led to pneumonia in from 10 to 20 percent of all cases. In the 
United States, this translated into two to three million cases. In other parts 
of the world, chieﬂy in isolated areas where people had rarely been exposed 
to inﬂuenza viruses—in Eskimo settlements of Alaska, in jungle villages 
of Africa, in islands of the Paciﬁc—the virus demonstrated extreme viru-
lence in far more than 20 percent of cases. These numbers most likely 
translate into several hundred million severe cases around the world in a 
world with a population less than one-third that of today. 
This was still inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza. The most common symptoms 
then as now are well known. The mucosal membranes in the nose, phar-
ynx, and throat become inﬂamed. The conjunctiva, the delicate mem-
brane that lines the eyelids, becomes inﬂamed. Victims suffer headache, 
body aches, fever, often complete exhaustion, cough. As one leading cli-
nician observed in 1918, the disease was “ushered in by two groups of 
symptoms: in the ﬁrst place the constitutional reactions of an acute 
febrile disease—headache, general aching, chills, fever, malaise, prostra-
tion, anorexia, nausea or vomiting; and in the second place, symptoms 
referable to an intense congestion of the mucous membranes of the nose, 
pharynx, larynx, trachea, and upper respiratory tract in general, and of 
the conjunctivae.” Another noted, “The disease began with absolute 
exhaustion and chill, fever, headache, conjunctivitis, pain in back and 
limbs, ﬂushing of face. . . . Cough  was often constant. Upper air passages 
were clogged.” A third reported, “In nonfatal cases . . .  the temperature 
ranged from 100 to 103F. Nonfatal cases usually recovered after an illness 
of about a week.” 
Then there were the cases in which the virus struck with violence. 
To those who suffered a violent attack, there was often pain, terriﬁc pain, 
and the pain could come almost anywhere. The disease also separated 
them, pushed them into a solitary and concentrated place. 
In Philadelphia, Clifford Adams said, “I didn’t think about any-
thing. . . . I got to  the point where I didn’t care if I died or not. I just felt 
like that all my life was nothing but when I breathe.” 
Bill Sardo in Washington, D.C., recalled, “I wasn’t expected to live, just 
"

like everybody else that had gotten it. . . . You were sick as a dog  and you 
weren’t in a coma but you were in a condition that at the height of the cri-
sis you weren’t thinking normally and you weren’t reacting normally, you 
sort of had delusions.” 
In Lincoln, Illinois, William Maxwell felt “time was a blur as I was 
lying in that little upstairs room and I . . .  had no sense of day or night, I 
felt sick and hollow inside and I knew from telephone calls my aunt had, 
I knew enough to be alarmed about my mother. . . . I  heard her say, ‘Will, 
oh no,’ and then, ‘if you want me to . . .’  The tears ran down her face so 
she didn’t need to tell me.” 
Josey Brown fell ill working as a nurse at the Great Lakes Naval Train-
ing Station and her “heart was racing so hard and pounding that it was 
going to jump out” of her chest and with terrible fevers she was “shaking 
so badly that the ice would rattle and would shake the chart attached to 
the end of the bed.” 
Harvey Cushing, Halsted’s protégé who had already attained promi-
nence himself but had yet to make his full reputation, served in France. 
On October 8, 1918, he wrote in his journal,“Something has happened to 
my hind legs and I wobble like a tabetic”—someone suffering from a 
long and wasting illness, like a person with AIDS who needs a cane— 
“and can’t feel the ﬂoor when I unsteadily get up in the morning. . . . So  
this is the sequence of the grippe. We may perhaps thank it for helping us 
win the war if it really hit the German Army thus hard [during their 
offensive].” In his case what seemed to be the complications were largely 
neurological. On October 31, after spending three weeks in bed with 
headache, double vision, and numbness of both legs, he observed, “It’s a 
curious business, unquestionably still progressing . . . with considerable 
muscular wasting. . . . I have a vague sense of familiarity with the sensa-
tion—as if I had met [it] somewhere in a dream.” Four days later: “My 
hands now have caught up with my feet—so numb and clumsy that shav-
ing’s a danger and buttoning laborious. When the periphery is thus 
affected the brain too is benumbed and awkward.” 
Cushing would never fully recover. 
And across the lines lay Rudolph Binding, a German ofﬁcer, who 
described his illness as “something like typhoid, with ghastly symptoms 
of intestinal poisoning.” For weeks he was “in the grip of the fever. Some 
days I am quite free; then again a weakness overcomes me so that I can

barely drag myself in a cold perspiration onto my bed and blankets. Then 
pain, so that I don’t care whether I am alive or dead.” 
Katherine Anne Porter was a reporter then, on the Rocky Mountain 
News. Her ﬁancé, a young ofﬁcer, died. He caught the disease nursing her, 
and she, too, was expected to die. Her colleagues set her obituary in type. 
She lived. In Pale Horse, Pale Rider she described her movement toward 
death: “She lay on a narrow ledge over a pit she knew to be bottomless . . .  
and soft carefully shaped words like oblivion and eternity are curtains 
hung before nothing at all. . . . Her  mind tottered and slithered again, 
broke from its foundation and spun like a cast wheel in a ditch. . . . She  
sank easily through deeps and deeps of darkness until she lay like a stone 
at the farthest bottom of life, knowing herself to be blind, deaf, speech-
less, no longer aware of the members of her own body, entirely with-
drawn from all human concerns, yet alive with a peculiar lucidity and 
coherence; all notions of the mind, all ties of blood and the desires of the 
heart, dissolved and fell away from her, and there remained of her only a 
minute ﬁercely burning particle of being that knew itself alone, that 
relied upon nothing beyond itself for its strength; not susceptible to any 
appeal or inducement, being itself composed entirely of one single 
motive, the stubborn will to live. This ﬁery motionless particle set itself 
unaided to resist destruction, to survive and to be in its own madness of 
being, motiveless and planless beyond that one essential end.” 
Then, as she climbed back from that depth, “Pain returned, a terrible 
compelling pain running through her veins like heavy ﬁre, the stench of 
corruption ﬁlled her nostrils, the sweetish sickening smell of rotting ﬂesh 
and pus; she opened her eyes and saw pale light through a coarse white 
cloth over her face, knew that the smell of death was in her own body, and 
struggled to lift her hand.” 
These victims came with an extraordinary array of symptoms, symptoms 
either previously unknown entirely in inﬂuenza or experienced with pre-
viously unknown intensity. Initially, physicians, good physicians, intelli-
gent physicians searching for a disease that ﬁtted the clues before 
them—and inﬂuenza did not ﬁt the clues—routinely misdiagnosed the 
disease. 
Patients would writhe from agonizing pain in their joints. Doctors 
would diagnose dengue, also called “breakbone fever.” 
"
"The Pestilence 
235 
Patients would suffer extreme fever and chills, shuddering, shivering, 
then huddling under blankets. Doctors would diagnose malaria. 
Dr. Henry Berg at New York City’s Willard Parker Hospital—across 
the street from William Park’s laboratory—worried that the patients’ 
complaints of “a burning pain above the diaphragm” meant cholera. 
Noted another doctor, “Many had vomiting; some became tender over 
the abdomen indicating an intra-abdominal condition.” 
In Paris, while some physicians also diagnosed cholera or dysentery, 
others interpreted the intensity and location of headache pain as typhoid. 
Deep into the epidemic Parisian physicians still remained reluctant to 
diagnose inﬂuenza. In Spain public health ofﬁcials also declared that 
the complications were due to “typhoid,” which was “general throughout 
Spain.” 
But neither typhoid nor cholera, neither dengue nor yellow fever, nei-
ther plague nor tuberculosis, neither diphtheria nor dysentery, could 
account for other symptoms. No known disease could. 
In Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine, a British physician 
noted “one thing I have never seen before—namely the occurrence of 
subcutaneous emphysema”—pockets of air accumulating just beneath 
the skin—“beginning in the neck and spreading sometimes over the 
whole body.” 
Those pockets of air leaking through ruptured lungs made patients 
crackle when they were rolled onto their sides. One navy nurse later com-
pared the sound to a bowl of rice crispies, and the memory of that sound 
was so vivid to her that for the rest of her life she could not tolerate being 
around anyone who was eating rice crispies. 
Extreme earaches were common. One physician observed that otitis 
media—inﬂammation of the middle ear marked by pain, fever, and 
dizziness—“developed with surprising rapidity, and rupture of the drum 
membrane was observed at times in a few hours after the onset of pain.” 
Another wrote, “Otitis media reported in 41 cases. Otologists on duty day 
and night and did immediate paracentesis [insertion of a needle to 
remove ﬂuid] on all bulging eardrums. . . .”  Another: “Discharge of pus 
from the external ear was noted. At autopsy practically every case showed 
otitis media with perforation. . . . This destructive action on the drum 
seems to me to be similar to the destructive action on the tissues of the 
lung.” 
"
"236 
The Great Influenza 
The headaches throbbed deep in the skull, victims feeling as if their 
heads would literally split open, as if a sledgehammer were driving a 
wedge not into the head but from inside the head out. The pain seemed 
to locate particularly behind the eye orbit and could be nearly unbearable 
when patients moved their eyes. There were areas of lost vision, areas 
where the normal frame of sight went black. Some paralysis of ocular 
muscles was frequently recorded, and German medical literature noted 
eye involvement with special frequency, sometimes in 25 percent of 
inﬂuenza cases. 
The ability to smell was affected, sometimes for weeks. Rarer compli-
cations included acute—even fatal—renal failure. Reye’s syndrome 
attacked the liver. An army summary later stated simply, “The symptoms 
were of exceeding variety as to severity and kind.” 
It was not only death but these symptoms that spread the terror. 
This was inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza. Yet to a layperson at home, to a wife 
caring for a husband, to a father caring for a child, to a brother caring for 
a sister, symptoms unlike anything they had seen terriﬁed. And the symp-
toms terriﬁed a Boy Scout delivering food to an incapacitated family; 
they terriﬁed a policeman who entered an apartment to ﬁnd a tenant 
dead or dying; they terriﬁed a man who volunteered his car as an ambu-
lance. The symptoms chilled laypeople, chilled them with winds of fear. 
The world looked black. Cyanosis turned it black. Patients might have 
few other symptoms at ﬁrst, but if nurses and doctors noted cyanosis 
they began to treat such patients as terminal, as the walking dead. If the 
cyanosis became extreme, death was certain. And cyanosis was common. 
One physician reported, “Intense cyanosis was a striking phenomenon. 
The lips, ears, nose, cheeks, tongue, conjunctivae, ﬁngers, and sometimes 
the entire body partook of a dusky, leaden hue.” And another: “Many 
patients exhibited upon admission a strikingly intense cyanosis, espe-
cially noticeable in the lips. This was not the dusky pallid blueness that 
one is accustomed to in a failing pneumonia, but rather [a] deep blue-
ness.” And a third: “In cases with bilateral lesions the cyanosis was 
marked, even to an indigo blue color. . . .  The pallor was of particularly 
bad prognostic import.” 
Then there was the blood, blood pouring from the body. To see blood 
trickle, and in some cases spurt, from someone’s nose, mouth, even from 
"
"The Pestilence

the ears or around the eyes, had to terrify. Terrifying as the bleeding was, 
it did not mean death, but even to physicians, even to those accustomed 
to thinking of the body as a machine and to trying to understand the dis-
ease process, symptoms like these previously unassociated with inﬂuenza 
had to be unsettling. For when the virus turned violent, blood was every-
where.* 
In U.S. Army cantonments, from 5 percent to 15 percent of all men 
hospitalized suffered from epistaxis—bleeding from the nose—as with 
hemorrhagic viruses such as Ebola. There are many reports that blood 
sometimes spurted from the nose with enough power to travel several 
feet. Doctors had no explanation for these symptoms. They could only 
report them. 
“15% suffered from epistaxis. . . .”  “In about one-half the cases a 
foamy, blood-stained liquid ran from the nose and mouth when the head 
was lowered. . . .”  “Epistaxis occurs in a considerable number of cases, in 
one person a pint of bright red blood gushing from the nostrils. . . .”  “A  
striking feature in the early stages of these cases was a bleeding from 
some portion of the body. . . . Six  cases vomited blood; one died from 
loss of blood from this cause.” 
What was this? 
“One of the most striking of the complications was hemorrhage from 
mucous membranes, especially from the nose, stomach, and intestine. 
Bleeding from the ears and petechial hemorrhages in the skin also 
occurred.” 
One German investigator recorded “hemorrhages occurring in differ-
ent parts of the interior of the eye” with great frequency. An American 
pathologist noted: “Fifty cases of subconjunctival hemorrhage [bleeding 
from the lining of the eye] were counted. Twelve had a true hemoptysis, 
bright red blood with no admixture of mucus. . . . Three  cases had intes-
tinal hemorrhage. . . .” 
“Female patients had a hemorrhagic vaginal discharge which was at 
ﬁrst considered to be coincident menstruation, but later was interpreted 
as hemorrhage form the uterine mucosa.” 
*Many mechanisms can cause bleeding in mucous membranes, and the precise 
way the inﬂuenza virus does this is unknown. Some viruses also attack platelets— 
which are necessary for clotting—directly or indirectly, and elements of the immune 
system may inadvertently attack platelets as well. 
"
"238 
The Great Influenza 
What was this? 
Never did the virus cause only a single symptom. The chief diag-
nostician in the New York City Health Department summarized, “Cases 
with intense pain look and act like cases of dengue . . . hemorrhage from 
nose or bronchi. . . . Expectoration is usually profuse and may be blood-
stained . . . paresis or paralysis of either cerebral or spinal origin . . . im-
pairment of motion may be severe or mild, permanent or temporary . . .  
physical and mental depression. Intense and protracted prostration led to 
hysteria, melancholia, and insanity with suicidal intent.” 
The impact on the mental state of the victims would be one of the 
most widely noted sequelae. 
During the course of the epidemic, 47 percent of all deaths in the United 
States, nearly half of all those who died from all causes combined—from 
cancer, from heart disease, from stroke, from tuberculosis, from acci-
dents, from suicide, from murder, and from all other causes—resulted 
from inﬂuenza and its complications. And it killed enough to depress the 
average life expectancy in the United States by more than ten years. 
Some of those who died from inﬂuenza and pneumonia would have 
died if no epidemic had occurred. Pneumonia was after all the leading 
cause of death. So the key ﬁgure is actually the “excess death” toll. Inves-
tigators today believe that in the United States the 1918–19 epidemic 
caused an excess death toll of about 675,000 people. The nation then had 
a population between 105 and 110 million, compared to 285 million in 
2004. So a comparable ﬁgure today would be approximately 1,750,000 
deaths. 
And there was something even beyond the gross numbers that gave 
the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic terrifying immediacy, brought it into every 
home, brought it into homes with the most life. 
Inﬂuenza almost always selects the weakest in a society to kill, the very 
young and the very old. It kills opportunistically, like a bully. It almost 
always allows the most vigorous, the most healthy, to escape, including 
young adults as a group. Pneumonia was even known as “the old man’s 
friend” for killing particularly the elderly, and doing so in a relatively 
painless and peaceful fashion that even allowed time to say good-bye. 
There was no such grace about inﬂuenza in 1918. It killed the young 
and strong. Studies worldwide all found the same thing. Young adults, the 
"
"The Pestilence 
239 
healthiest and strongest part of the population, were the most likely to 
die. Those with the most to live for—the robust, the ﬁt, the hearty, the 
ones raising young sons and daughters—those were the ones who died. 
In South African cities, those between the ages of twenty and forty 
accounted for 60 percent of the deaths. In Chicago the deaths among 
those aged twenty to forty almost quintupled deaths of those aged forty-
one to sixty. A Swiss physician “saw no severe case in anyone over 50.” In 
the “registration area” of the United States—those states and cities that 
kept reliable statistics—breaking the population into ﬁve-year incre-
ments, the single greatest number of deaths occurred in men and women 
aged twenty-ﬁve to twenty-nine, the second-greatest number in those 
aged thirty to thirty-four, the third-greatest in those aged twenty to 
twenty-four. And more people died in each of those ﬁve-year groups than 
the total deaths among all those over age sixty. 
Graphs that correlate mortality rates and age in inﬂuenza outbreaks 
always—always, that is, except for 1918–19—start out with a peak repre-
senting infant deaths, then fall into a valley, then rise again, with a second 
peak representing people somewhere past sixty-ﬁve or so. With mortality 
on the vertical and age on the horizontal, a graph of the dead would like 
like a U. 
But 1918 was different. Infants did die then in large numbers, and so 
did the elderly. But in 1918 the great spike came in the middle. In 1918 an 
age graph of the dead would look like a W. 
It is a graph that tells a story of utter tragedy. Even at the front in 
France, Harvey Cushing recognized this tragedy and called the victims 
“doubly dead in that they died so young.” 
In the American military alone, inﬂuenza-related deaths totaled just 
over the number of Americans killed in combat in Vietnam. One in every 
sixty-seven soldiers in the army died of inﬂuenza and its complications, 
nearly all of them in a ten-week period beginning in mid-September. 
But inﬂuenza of course did not kill only men in the military. In the 
United States it killed ﬁfteen times as many civilians as military. And 
among young adults still another demographic stood out. Those most 
vulnerable of all to inﬂuenza, those most likely of the most likely to die, 
were pregnant women. As far back as the year 1557, observers connected 
inﬂuenza with miscarriage and the death of pregnant women. In thirteen 
studies of hospitalized pregnant women during the 1918 pandemic, the 
"
"240 
The Great Influenza 
death rate ranged from 23 percent to 71 percent. Of the pregnant women 
who survived, 26 percent lost the child. And these women were the most 
likely group to already have other children, so an unknown but enor-
mous number of children lost their mothers. 
The most pregnant word in science is “interesting.” It suggests something 
new, puzzling, and potentially signiﬁcant. Welch had asked Burt Wol-
bach, the brilliant chief pathologist at the great Boston hospital known as 
“the Brigham,” to investigate the Devens cases. Wolbach called it “the 
most interesting pathological experience I have ever had.” 
The epidemiology of this pandemic was interesting. The unusual 
symptoms were interesting. And the autopsies—and some symptoms 
revealed themselves only in autopsy—were interesting. The damage this 
virus caused and its epidemiology presented a deep mystery. An explana-
tion would come—but not for decades. 
In the meantime this inﬂuenza, for it was after all only inﬂuenza, left 
almost no internal organ untouched. Another distinguished pathologist 
noted that the brain showed “marked hyperemia”—blood ﬂooding the 
brain, probably because of an out-of-control inﬂammatory response— 
adding, “the convolutions of the brain were ﬂattened and the brain tis-
sues were noticeably dry.” 
The virus inﬂamed or affected the pericardium—the sac of tissue and 
ﬂuid that protects the heart—and the heart muscle itself, noted others. 
The heart was also often “relaxed and ﬂabby, offering strong contrast to 
the ﬁrm, contracted left ventricle nearly always present in post-mortem 
in patients dying from lobar pneumonia.” 
The amount of damage to the kidneys varied but at least some dam-
age “occurred in nearly every case.” The liver was sometimes damaged. 
The adrenal glands suffered “necrotic areas, frank hemorrhage, and occa-
sionally abscesses. . . . When  not involved in the hemorrhagic process 
they usually showed considerable congestion.” 
Muscles along the rib cage were torn apart both by internal toxic 
processes and by the external stress of coughing, and in many other mus-
cles pathologists noted “necrosis,” or “waxy degeneration.” 
Even the testes showed “very striking changes . . . encountered in 
nearly every case. . . . It  was difﬁcult to understand why such severe toxic 
lesions of the muscle and the testis should occur. . . .”

And, ﬁnally, came the lungs. 
Physicians had seen lungs in such condition. But those lungs had not 
come from pneumonia patients. Only one known disease—a particularly 
virulent form of bubonic plague called pneumonic plague, which kills 
approximately 90 percent of its victims—ripped the lungs apart in the 
way this disease did. So did weapons in war. 
An army physician concluded, “The only comparable ﬁndings are 
those of pneumonic plague and those seen in acute death from toxic gas.” 
Seventy years after the pandemic, Edwin Kilbourne, a highly 
respected scientist who has spent much of his life studying inﬂuenza, 
conﬁrmed this observation, stating that the condition of the lungs was 
“unusual in other viral respiratory infections and is reminiscent of 
lesions seen following inhalation of poison gas.” 
But the cause was not poison gas, and it was not pneumonic plague. It 
was only inﬂuenza.

n 1918 in particular, inﬂuenza struck so suddenly that many vic-
tims could remember the precise instant they knew they were sick, so 
suddenly that throughout the world reports were common of people 
who toppled off horses, collapsed on the sidewalk. 
Death itself could come so fast. Charles-Edward Winslow, a promi-
nent epidemiologist and professor at Yale, noted, “We have had a number 
of cases where people were perfectly healthy and died within twelve 
hours.” The Journal of the American Medical Association carried reports of 
death within hours: “One robust person showed the ﬁrst symptom at 
4:00 p.m. and died by 10:00 a.m.” In  The Plague of the Spanish Lady: The 
Inﬂuenza Pandemic of 1918-1919, writer Richard Collier recounted this: 
In Rio de Janeiro, a man asked medical student Ciro Viera Da Cunha, 
who was waiting for a streetcar, for information in a perfectly normal 
voice, then fell down, dead; in Cape Town, South Africa, Charles Lewis 
boarded a streetcar for a three-mile trip home when the conductor col-
lapsed, dead. In the next three miles six people aboard the streetcar died, 
including the driver. 
Lewis stepped off the streetcar and walked home. 
It was the lungs that had attracted attention from pathologists ﬁrst. 
Physicians and pathologists had many times seen lungs of those dead of 
pneumonia. Many of the deaths from inﬂuenzal pneumonia did look like 
"
"The Pestilence 
243 
these normal pneumonias. And the later in the epidemic a victim died, 
the higher was the percentage of autopsy ﬁndings that resembled normal 
pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia. 
Those who died very quickly, a day or even less after the ﬁrst symp-
toms, however, most likely died of an overwhelming and massive inva-
sion of the virus itself. The virus destroyed enough cells in the lung to 
block the exchange of oxygen. This alone was unusual and puzzling. But 
the lungs of the men and women who died two days, three days, four days 
after the ﬁrst symptom of inﬂuenza bore no resemblance to normal 
pneumonias at all. They were more unusual, more puzzling. 
In April a Chicago pathologist had sent lung-tissue samples to the 
head of a research institute and asked him “to look over it as a new dis-
ease.” British pathologists in France had commented on strange autopsy 
ﬁndings in the spring. Capps had mentioned unusual ﬁndings in the 
lungs to Welch, Cole, and other members of the inspection party in June. 
The lungs Welch himself had seen in the Devens autopsy room had made 
him fear that the disease was a new one. 
The respiratory tract serves a single purpose: to transfer oxygen from 
the air into red blood cells. One can picture the entire system as an inverted 
oak tree. The trachea—the windpipe—carries air from the outside world 
into the lungs and is the equivalent of the tree trunk. This trunk then 
divides into two great branches, each called a “primary bronchus,” which 
carry oxygen into the right and left lungs. Each primary bronchus subdi-
vides into smaller and smaller bronchi, smaller branches, as they enter 
the lungs until they become “bronchioles.” (Bronchi have cartilage, which 
helps give the lung a kind of architectural structure; bronchioles do not 
have cartilage.) 
Each lung itself subdivides into lobes—the right lung has three, the 
left only two. The lobes subdivide into a total of nineteen smaller pock-
ets. Within these pockets, sprouting like leaves from the smaller bronchi 
and the bronchioles, are clusters of tiny sacs called alveoli. They are much 
like tiny but porous balloons, and the average person has 300 million of 
them. The alveoli play a role comparable to that which leaves play in pho-
tosynthesis. In the alveoli, the actual transfer of oxygen into the blood 
takes place. 
The right side of the heart pumps blood without oxygen into the lungs, 
where it passes into capillaries, the smallest blood vessels, so small that 
"
"244 
The Great Influenza 
individual blood cells often move in single ﬁle. Capillaries surround the 
alveoli, and oxygen molecules slip through the membrane of the alveolar 
tissue and attach to the hemoglobin of the red blood cells as they circu-
late past them. After picking up oxygen, the blood returns to the left side 
of the heart, where it is pumped through arteries throughout the body. 
(The body’s entire blood supply moves through the lungs each minute.) 
In arteries, red blood cells carry oxygen and are bright red; in veins, 
such as those visible on one’s wrist, the same cells without oxygen are 
bluish. When the lungs fail to oxygenate the blood, part of the body, and 
in some cases the entire body, can turn blue, causing cyanosis. Lack of 
oxygen, if extended for any length of time, damages and ultimately kills 
other organs in the body. 
Healthy lung tissue is light, spongy, and porous, much lighter than 
water, and a good insulator of sound. A physician percussing the chest of 
a healthy patient will hear little. When normal lung tissue is manipulated, 
it “crepitates”: as the air in the alevoli escapes, it makes a crackling noise 
similar to rubbing hairs together. 
A congested lung sounds different from a healthy one: solid tissue 
conducts breathing sounds to the chest wall, so someone listening can 
hear “rales,” crackling or wheezing sounds (although it can also sound 
either dull or hyperresonant). If the congestion is dense enough and 
widespread enough the lung is “consolidated.” 
In bronchopneumonia, bacteria—and many kinds of bacteria can do 
this—invade the alveoli themselves. Immune-system cells follow them 
there, and so do antibodies, ﬂuid, and other proteins and enzymes. An 
infected alveolus becomes dense with this material, which prevents 
it from transferring oxygen to the blood. This “consolidation” appears 
in patches surrounding the bronchi, and the infection is usually fairly 
localized. 
In lobar pneumonia, entire lobes become consolidated and trans-
formed into a liverlike mass—hence the word “hepatization” to describe 
it. A hepatized lobe can turn various colors depending on the stage of dis-
ease; grey hepatization, for example, indicates that various kinds of white 
blood cells have poured into the lung to ﬁght an infection. A diseased 
lung also includes the detritus of dissolved cells, along with various pro-
teins such as ﬁbrin and collagen that are part of the body’s efforts to 
repair damage. (These repair efforts can cause their own problems. 
"
"The Pestilence 
245 
“Fibrosis” occurs when too much ﬁbrin interferes with the normal func-
tioning of the lung.) 
Roughly two-thirds of all bacterial pneumonias and an even higher 
percentage of lobar pneumonias are caused by a single group of bacteria, 
the various subtypes of the pneumococcus. (The pneumococcus is also 
the second leading cause of meningitis.) A virulent pneumococcus can 
spread through an entire lobe within a matter of hours. Even today, in 20 
to 30 percent of the cases of lobar pneumonia, bacteria also spread through 
the blood to infect other areas of the body, and many victims still die. 
Some cyanosis is not unusual in lobar pneumonia, but most of the lung 
often still looks normal. 
In 1918 pathologists did see at autopsy the normal devastation of the 
lungs caused by the usual lobar and bronchopneumonias. But the lungs 
from those who died quickly during the pandemic, the lungs that so con-
fused even Welch, those lungs were different. Said one pathologist, “Phys-
ical signs were confusing. Typical consolidation was seldom found.” And 
another: “The old classiﬁcation by distribution of the lesions was inap-
propriate.” And another: “Essentially toxic damage to alevolar walls and 
exudation of blood and ﬂuid. Very little evidence of bacterial action 
could be found in some of these cases.” 
At a discussion reported in the Journal of the American Medical Asso-
ciation, several pathologists concurred, “The pathological picture was 
striking, and was unlike any type of pneumonia ordinarily seen in this 
country. . . . The lung  lesions, complex and variable, struck one as being 
quite different in character to anything one had met with at all commonly 
in the thousands of autopsies one had performed during the last 20 years.” 
Normally when the lungs are removed they collapse like deﬂated bal-
loons. Not now. Now they were full, but not of air. In bacterial pneumo-
nias, normally the infection rages inside the alveoli, inside the tiny sacs. 
In 1918, while the alveoli were also sometimes invaded, the spaces between 
the alveoli were ﬁlled. This space, which makes up the bulk of the volume 
of the lung, was ﬁlled with the debris of destroyed cells and with every 
element of the immune system, from enzymes to white blood cells. And 
it was ﬁlled with blood. 
One more observer concluded that “the acute death” he saw evidence 
of in the lungs “is a lesion which does not occur in other types of pul-
monary infection. In inﬂuenza it is the lesion of characterization.”

Victims’ lungs were being ripped apart as a result of, in effect, collateral 
damage from the attack of the immune system on the virus. Since the 
respiratory tract must allow outside air to pass into the innermost recesses 
of the body, it is extremely well defended. The lungs became the battle-
ground between the invaders and the immune system. Nothing was left 
standing on that battleground. 
The immune system begins its defense far in advance of the lungs, 
with enzymes in saliva that destroy some pathogens (including HIV, 
which makes its home in most bodily ﬂuids, but not in saliva, where 
enzymes kill it). Then it raises physical obstacles, such as nasal hairs that 
ﬁlter out large particles and sharp turns in the throat that force inhaled 
air to collide with the sides of breathing passageways. 
Mucus lines these passageways and traps organisms and irritants. 
Underneath the layer of mucus lies a blanket of “epithelial cells,” and 
from their surfaces extend “cilia,” akin to tiny hairs which, like tiny oars, 
sweep upward continuously at from 1,000 to 1,500 beats a minute. This 
sweeping motion moves foreign organisms away from places they can 
lodge and launch an infection, and up to the larynx. If something does 
gain a foothold in the upper respiratory tract, the body ﬁrst tries to ﬂush 
it out with more ﬂuid—hence the typical runny nose—and then expel it 
with coughs and sneezes. 
These defenses are as physical as raising an arm to block a punch and 
do no damage to the lungs. Even if the body overreacts, this usually does 
no serious harm, although an increased volume of mucus blocks air pas-
sages and makes breathing more difﬁcult. (In allergies these same symp-
toms occur because the immune system does overreact.) 
There are more aggressive defenses. Macrophages and “natural 
killer” cells—two kinds of white blood cells that seek and destroy all 
foreign invaders, unlike other elements of the immune system that only 
attack a speciﬁc threat—patrol the entire respiratory tract and lungs. 
Cells in the respiratory tract secrete enzymes that attack bacteria 
and some viruses (including inﬂuenza) or block them from attaching to 
tissue beneath the mucus, and these secretions also bring more white 
cells and antibacterial enzymes into a counterattack; if a virus is the 
invader, white blood cells also secrete interferon, which can block viral 
infection. 
"
"The Pestilence 
247 
All these defenses work so well that the lungs themselves, although 
directly exposed to outside air, are normally sterile. 
But when the lungs do become infected, other defenses, lethal and 
violent defenses, come into play. For the immune system is at its core a 
killing machine. It targets infecting organisms, attacks with a complex 
arsenal of weapons—some of them savage weapons—and neutralizes or 
kills the invader. 
The balance, however, between kill and overkill, response and overre-
sponse, is a delicate one. The immune system can behave like a SWAT 
team that kills the hostage along with the hostage taker, or the army that 
destroys the village to save it. 
In 1918 especially, this question of balance played a crucial role in the 
war between virus and immune system, and between life and death. The 
virus was often so efﬁcient at invading the lungs that the immune system 
had to mount a massive response to it. What was killing young adults a 
few days after the ﬁrst symptom was not the virus. The killer was the mas-
sive immune response itself. 
The virus attaches itself normally to epithelial cells, which line the entire 
respiratory tract like insulation in a tube all the way to the alveoli. Within 
ﬁfteen minutes after inﬂuenza viruses invade the body, their hemagglu-
tinin spikes begin binding with the sialic-acid receptors on these cells. 
One after another these spikes attach to the receptors, each one a grap-
pling hook binding the virus tighter and tighter to the cell. Generally 
about ten hours after the virus invades a cell, the cell bursts open, releas-
ing between 1,000 and 10,000 viruses capable of infecting other cells. At 
even the lowest reproduction rate—1,000 times 1,000 times 1,000, and so 
on—one can easily understand how a victim could feel perfectly healthy 
one moment and collapse the next, just as the ﬁfth or sixth generation of 
viruses matures and infects cells. 
Meanwhile, the virus is also attacking the immune system directly, 
undermining the body’s ability to protect itself; the virus inhibits the 
release of interferon, and interferon is usually the ﬁrst weapon the body 
employs to ﬁght viral infection. In 1918 the ability to inhibit the immune 
system was so obvious that researchers, even while overwhelmed by the 
pandemic, noticed that inﬂuenza victims had weakened immune 
responses to other stimuli; they used objective tests to prove it. 
"
"248 
The Great Influenza 
Even mild inﬂuenza viruses can utterly and entirely denude the upper 
respiratory tract of epithelial cells, leaving it bare, stripping the throat 
raw. (The repair process begins within a few days but takes weeks.) 
Once an infection gains a foothold, the immune system responds ini-
tially with inﬂammation. The immune system can inﬂame at the site of 
an infection, causing the redness, heat, and swelling there, or it can inﬂame 
the entire body through fever, or both. 
The actual process of inﬂammation involves the release by certain 
white blood cells of proteins called “cytokines.” There are many kinds of 
white cells; several kinds attack invading organisms, while other “helper” 
cells manage attacks, and still others produce antibodies. There are even 
more kinds of cytokines. Some cytokines attack invaders directly, such 
as interferon, which attacks viruses. Some act as messengers carrying 
orders. Macrophages, for example, release “GM CSF,” which stands for 
“granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor”; GM CSF stimu-
lates the production in the bone marrow of more macrophages as well as 
granulocytes, another kind of white blood cell. Some cytokines also carry 
messages to parts of the body not normally considered belonging to the 
immune system; several cytokines can affect the hypothalamus, which 
acts like the body’s thermostat. When these cytokines bind to receptors in 
the hypothalamus, body temperature goes up; the entire body becomes 
inﬂamed. (Fever is part of the immune response; some pathogens do not 
grow well at higher temperatures.) In inﬂuenza, fever routinely climbs to 
103, and can go higher. 
But cytokines themselves also have toxic effects. The typical symp-
toms of inﬂuenza outside the respiratory tract, the headache and body 
ache, are caused not by the virus but by cytokines. A side effect of 
cytokines’ stimulating the bone marrow to make more white cells, for 
instance, is likely what aches in the bone. 
Cytokines can cause more serious and permanent damage as well. 
“Tumor necrosis factor,” to give one example, is a cytokine that gets its 
name from its ability to kill cancer cells—tumors exposed to TNF in the 
laboratory simply melt away; it also helps raise body temperature and 
stimulates antibody production. But TNF is extraordinarily lethal, and 
not just to diseased cells. It can destroy healthy ones as well. In fact, it can 
kill the entire body. TNF is a toxin and a major cause of toxic shock syn-
drome, and it is not the only toxic cytokine. 
"

249 
Routinely, the body ﬁghts off the inﬂuenza virus before it gains a solid 
foothold in the lungs themselves. But in 1918 the virus often succeeded in 
infecting epithelial cells not only in the upper respiratory tract but all the 
way down the respiratory tract into the innermost sanctuaries of the 
lungs, into the epithelial cells of the alveoli. This was viral pneumonia. 
The immune system followed the virus into the lungs and there waged 
war. In this war the immune system held nothing back. It used all its 
weapons. And it killed. It killed particularly with “killer T cells,” a white 
blood cell that targets the body’s own cells when they are infected with a 
virus, and it killed with what is sometimes referred to as a “cytokine 
storm,” a massive attack using every lethal weapon the body possesses. 
The same capillaries that moved blood past the alveoli delivered this 
attack. The capillaries dilated, pouring out ﬂuid, every kind of white blood 
cell, antibodies, other elements of the immune system, and cytokines into 
the lung. Then these cytokines and other enzymes virtually obliterated 
the capillaries. Even more ﬂuid poured into the lung. The cells that line 
the alveoli were damaged, if they survived the virus itself. Pink glassy 
membranes, called hyaline membranes, formed on the insides of the 
alveoli. Once these membranes formed, “surfactant”—a slippery, soap-
like protein that reduces surface tension and eases the transfer of oxygen 
into red blood cells—disappeared from the alveoli. More blood ﬂooded 
the lungs. The body started producing ﬁberlike connective tissue. Areas 
of the lung became enmeshed in cell debris, ﬁbrin, collagen, and other 
materials. Proteins and ﬂuid ﬁlled the space between cells. 
Macfarlane Burnet, the Nobel laureate, described what was happen-
ing inside the lungs: “acute inﬂammatory injection . . . very rapid necro-
sis of most of the epithelial lining of the bronchial tree down to and 
especially involving the smallest bronchioles. . . .  Essentially toxic dam-
age to alveolar walls and exudation of blood and ﬂuid . . .  [C]ontinued 
exudation of ﬂuid in areas where blocking of smaller bronchi had 
occurred would produce eventually airless regions.” 
The immune system changes with age. Young adults have the strongest 
immune system in the population, most capable of mounting a massive 
immune response. Normally that makes them the healthiest element of 
the population. Under certain conditions, however, that very strength 
becomes a weakness. 
In 1918 the immune systems of young adults mounted massive 
"
"250 
The Great Influenza 
responses to the virus. That immune response ﬁlled the lungs with ﬂuid 
and debris, making it impossible for the exchange of oxygen to take place. 
The immune response killed. 
The inﬂuenza outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong, when a new virus 
jumped from chickens to humans, killed only six people and it did not 
adapt to man. More than a million chickens were slaughtered to prevent 
that from happening, and the outbreak has been much studied. In autop-
sies pathologists noticed extremely high cytokine levels, discovered even 
that the bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, spleen—all involved in the 
immune response—and other organs were themselves under attack from 
an immune system turned renegade. They believed that this proved “syn-
drome [was] not previously described with inﬂuenza.” In fact, investiga-
tors in 1918 had seen the same thing. 
This was still inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza. 
In the 1970s physicians began to recognize a pathological process in the 
lungs that could have many causes but, once the process began, looked 
the same and received the same treatment. They called it ARDS, which 
stands for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Almost anything that 
puts extreme stress on the lung can cause ARDS: near drowning, smoke 
inhalation, inhaling toxic fumes (or poison gas) . . . or  inﬂuenzal viral 
pneumonia. Doctors today looking at pathology reports of lungs in 1918 
would immediately designate the condition as ARDS. 
One pulmonary expert describes ARDS as “a burn inside the lungs.” It 
is a virtual scorching of lung tissue. When viral pneumonia causes the 
condition, the immune system toxins designed to destroy invaders are 
what, in effect, ﬂame in the lung, scorching the tissue. 
Whatever the causes of ARDS, even today there is no way of stopping 
the process of disintegration in the lung once it begins. The only care is 
supportive, keeping the victim alive until he or she can recover. This 
requires all the technology of modern intensive care units. Still, even with 
the best modern care, even with for example dramatically more efﬁcient 
and effective administration of oxygen than in 1918, the mortality rate 
for ARDS patients in different studies ranges from 40 to 60 percent. 
Without intensive care—and hospitals have few beds in intensive-care 
units—the mortality rate would approach 100 percent. 
(In 2003 a new coronavirus that causes SARS, “Severe Acute Respira-
"
"251 
The Pestilence 
tory Syndrome,” appeared in China and quickly spread around the world. 
Coronaviruses cause an estimated 15 to 30 percent of all colds and, like 
the inﬂuenza virus, infect epithelial cells. When the coronavirus that 
causes SARS does kill, it often kills through ARDS, although since the 
virus replicates much more slowly than inﬂuenza, death from ARDS can 
come several weeks after the ﬁrst symptoms.) 
In ARDS, death can come from many causes. Organs outside the 
lungs fail because they get too little oxygen. The lungs can so ﬁll with 
ﬂuid that the right ventricle of the heart cannot empty it so the victim 
drowns. The strain of trying to pump blood out of the lung can cause 
heart failure. Or the victim can simply die from exhaustion: he or she 
must breathe so rapidly to get enough oxygen that muscles become 
exhausted. Breathing just stops. 
ARDS by no means accounts for all the inﬂuenza deaths in 1918 and 1919, 
or even for a majority of them. It explains only those who died in a 
few days, and it explains why so many young healthy people died. 
Although inﬂuenza almost certainly killed some people in ways that had 
little to do with the lungs—for example, someone whose already weak 
heart could not stand the additional strain of ﬁghting the disease— 
the overwhelming majority of non-ARDS deaths came from bacterial 
pneumonias. 
The destruction of the epithelial cells eliminated the sweeping action 
that clears so much of the respiratory tract of bacteria, and the virus 
damaged or exhausted other parts of the immune system as well. That 
gave the normal bacterial ﬂora of the mouth unimpeded entry into the 
lungs. Recent research also suggests that the neuraminidase on the 
inﬂuenza virus makes it easier for some bacteria to attach to lung tissue, 
creating a lethal synergy between the virus and these bacteria. And in the 
lungs, the bacteria began to grow. 
Bacterial pneumonias developed a week, two weeks, three weeks after 
someone came down with inﬂuenza, including even a seemingly mild 
case of inﬂuenza. Often inﬂuenza victims seemed to recover, even returned 
to work, then suddenly collapsed again with bacterial pneumonia. 
It is impossible to know what percentage of the dead were killed by a 
viral pneumonia and ARDS and how many died from bacterial pneumo-
nias. Generally speaking, epidemiologists and historians who have writ-

ten about this pandemic have assumed that the overwhelming majority 
of deaths came from secondary invaders, from bacterial pneumonias that 
can be fought with antibiotics. 
The conclusion of the army’s pneumonia commission, however, is 
chilling in terms of implications for today. This commission, comprised 
of half a dozen of the ﬁnest scientists in America, both conducted autop-
sies and reviewed pathology reports of others; it found signs of what 
would today be called ARDS in almost half the autopsies. A separate 
study limited to the pathology of the disease, conducted by Milton Win-
ternitz, a Welch protégé and later dean of the Yale Medical School, 
reached the same conclusion. 
That overstates the proportion of victims who died from ARDS—in 
effect from inﬂuenzal viral pneumonia—because the army study looked 
only at deaths among soldiers, men who were young and otherwise 
healthy, the group most likely to have been killed by their own immune 
systems. In the total population, viral pneumonias and ARDS would not 
account for as high a percentage of the deaths. Most deaths almost cer-
tainly did come from secondary bacterial infections, but probably not 
quite so many as has been assumed. That should, however, be small com-
fort for those who worry about the next inﬂuenza pandemic. 
The 1957 pandemic struck in the golden age of antibiotics, but even 
then just 25 percent of the fatalities had viral pneumonia only; three-
quarters of the deaths came from complications, generally bacterial 
pneumonia. Since then bacterial resistance has become a major problem 
in medicine. Today the mortality rate for a bacterial pneumonia follow-
ing inﬂuenza is still roughly 7 percent, and in some parts of the United 
States, 35 percent of pneumococcal infections are resistant to the anti-
biotic of choice. When staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that has become 
particularly troubling in hospitals because of its resistance to antibiotics, 
is the secondary invader, the death rate—today—rises to as high as 42 
percent. That is higher than the general death rate from bacterial pneu-
monias in 1918.

ature chose to rage in 1918, and it chose the form of the in-
ﬂuenza virus in which to do it. This meant that nature ﬁrst crept 
upon the world in familiar, almost comic, form. It came in masquerade. 
Then it pulled down its mask and showed its ﬂeshless bone. 
Then, as the pathogen spread from cantonments to cities, as it spread 
within cities, as it moved from city to town to village to farmhouse, med-
ical science began moving as well. It began its own race against the 
pathogen, moving more rapidly and with more purpose than it ever had. 
Scientists did not presume to think that they would or could control 
this rage of nature. But they did not abandon their search for ways to 
control the damage of this rage. They still tried to save lives. 
Worldwide their struggle, their race, commenced. In the United States 
that struggle would be fought by Welch, Gorgas, Cole, and their colleagues, 
as well as by the institutions they had built and the men and women they 
had trained. Neither these institutions nor these men and women had 
ever been tested like this. They had never imagined they would be tested 
like this. But any possibility of affecting the course of the disease lay in 
their hands. 
To save lives they needed the answer to at least one of three questions. It 
was possible that even a single rough approximation of an answer would 
give them enough knowledge to intervene, to interrupt the disease at 
"
"256 
The Great Influenza 
some critical juncture. But it was also possible they could learn detailed 
answers to all three questions and still remain helpless, utterly helpless. 
First, they needed to understand the epidemiology of inﬂuenza, how it 
behaved and spread. Scientists had already learned to control cholera, 
typhoid, yellow fever, malaria, bubonic plague, and other diseases by under-
standing their epidemiology even before developing either a vaccine or cure. 
Second, they needed to learn its pathology, what it did within the 
body, the precise course of the disease. That too might allow them to 
intervene in some way that saved lives. 
Third, they needed to know what the pathogen was, what microor-
ganism caused inﬂuenza. This could allow them to ﬁnd a way to stimu-
late the immune system to prevent or cure the disease. It was also 
conceivable that even without knowing the precise cause, they could 
develop a serum or vaccine. 
The easiest question to answer for inﬂuenza was its epidemiology. Al-
though some respected investigators still believed in the miasma theory— 
they thought inﬂuenza spread too fast for person-to-person contact to 
account for it—most believed correctly it was an airborne pathogen. 
Breathing it in could cause the disease. They did not know the exact, pre-
cise details, that for example when the virus ﬂoats in the air it can infect 
someone else for anywhere from an hour to a day after it is exhaled (the 
lower the humidity, the longer the virus survives). But they did know that 
it was “a crowd disease,” spread most easily in crowds. 
They also had an accurate estimate that someone with inﬂuenza 
“sheds” the virus—can infect others—usually from the third to the sixth 
day after he or she is infected. 
They also believed, correctly, that people could catch inﬂuenza not 
only by inhaling it but by hand-to-mouth or -nose contact. They rightly 
thought, for instance, that a sick person could cover his mouth with his 
hand when he coughed, then several hours later shake hands, and the sec-
ond person could then rub his chin in thought or touch his nose or stick 
a piece of candy in his mouth and infect himself. Similarly, someone sick 
could cough into a hand, touch a hard surface such as a doorknob, and 
spread it to someone else who turns the doorknob and later brings a 
hand to face. (In fact, the virus can remain infectious on a hard surface 
for up to two days.) 
Knowledge of inﬂuenza’s epidemiology, then, was of little use. Only

ruthless isolation and quarantine could affect its course. No scientist and 
no public health ofﬁcial had the political power to take such action. Some 
local authorities might take some action, but no national ﬁgure could. 
Even within the army Gorgas’s urgent and desperate calls to end the 
transfer of troops were ignored. 
Scientists were also learning too well about the pathology of the dis-
ease and its natural course. They were learning chieﬂy that they could do 
almost nothing to intervene in serious cases, in the cases that progressed 
to viral pneumonia and ARDS; even administering oxygen seemed to 
have no effect. 
They believed they could, however, possibly save lives if they could 
prevent or treat the slower moving pneumonias caused by what they 
were fairly quickly suspecting to be secondary invaders. Some preventive 
measures involved only giving proper guidance, such as to rest in bed 
after inﬂuenza infection, or giving good care, which was becoming more 
and more impossible as the numbers of the sick rose, as nurses and doc-
tors themselves succumbed. 
But if they could ﬁnd the pathogen . . . They had tools, they could 
manipulate the immune system, they could prevent and cure some 
pneumonias—including the most common pneumonias. The conquest 
of bacterial pneumonias seemed tantalizingly within the reach of science, 
tantalizingly at the very edge of scientists’ reach—or just beyond it. If 
they could just ﬁnd the pathogen . . .  
All the energies of science rose to that challenge. 
William Welch himself would not rise to it. From Camp Devens he had 
returned directly to Baltimore, neither stopping in New York City nor going 
on to report to the surgeon general’s ofﬁce in Washington. Others could 
perform that duty, and on the phone he had said what he had to say. 
In the meantime Welch wasn’t feeling very well. No doubt he tried to 
shrug off the discomfort. He had, after all, had an exceedingly difﬁcult 
trip. Just before going to Devens he, Cole, and Vaughan had concluded 
their latest round of camp inspections and had just begun to relax for a 
few days in Asheville, North Carolina. He had even contemplated resign-
ing his commission. Then they had been abruptly ordered to the surgeon 
general’s ofﬁce on a Sunday, gone straight on to Devens, and there dis-
covered this terrible disease.

The Great Influenza 
So he had every reason to be tired and out of sorts. Likely he told him-
self something akin to that. The rattling of the train would have dis-
turbed him, exacerbating the ﬁrst signs of a headache. Large a man as he 
was, he had difﬁculty getting comfortable on a train anyway. 
But as the train moved south he felt worse and worse, perhaps suffer-
ing a sudden violent headache and an unproductive cough, cough in 
which nothing came up, and certainly with a fever. He would have looked 
at himself clinically, objectively, and made a correct diagnosis. He had 
inﬂuenza. 
No record exists of his precise clinical course. All of Baltimore, all of 
the East Coast, was erupting in ﬂames. The virus struck the Hopkins itself 
so hard that the university closed its hospital to all but its own staff and 
students. Three Hopkins medical students, three Hopkins nurses, and 
three Hopkins doctors would die. 
Welch did not go to the hospital. Almost seventy years old, forty years 
older than those who were dying in the greatest numbers, having just left 
the horror at Devens and knowing the enormous strain on and therefore 
the likely poor care even at the Hopkins facility, he later said, “I could not 
have dreamed of going to a hospital at that time.” 
Instead, he went to bed immediately in his own rooms, and stayed 
there. He knew better than to push himself now: pushing oneself after 
infection with this disease could easily open the path for a secondary 
invader to kill. After ten days in bed at home, when he felt well enough to 
travel at all, to recuperate more he withdrew entirely to his beloved Hotel 
Dennis in Atlantic City, the odd tacky place that was his haven. 
In the midst of the chaos that was everywhere, he returned to this 
familiar place that gave him comfort. What had he always liked about it? 
Perhaps the life that roared through it. Quiet resorts bored him: he 
described Mohonk, a mountain resort ninety miles above New York City, 
as “a kind of twin-lakes-resort with Miss Dares sitting in rockers on the 
broad piazza, . . . where it seems as if  nine o’clock will never come so that 
one could go decently to bed . . . [C]olored neckties are not allowed.” But 
Atlantic City! and “the most terrifying, miraculous, blood-curdling affair 
called the Flip-ﬂap railroad . . . just built on a long pier out over the 
ocean . . .  [Y]ou go down from a height of about 75 feet . . . with the 
head down and the feet up, so that you would drop out of the car, if it was 
not for the tremendous speed. As you go round the circle the effect is

indescribable. . . . Crowds  stand around and say they would not try it for 
$1000.” 
Yes, the life that roared through Atlantic City—the young men and 
women and their frolicking, the sensuality of sweat and surf and salt, the 
vibrancy and thrust of ﬂesh about the ocean and boardwalk, all that— 
made one feel as if one were not merely observing but partaking. But now 
Atlantic City was quiet. It was October, off-season, the resorts quiet. And 
here, as everywhere, was inﬂuenza. Here, as everywhere, there was a 
shortage of doctors, a shortage of nurses, a shortage of hospitals, a short-
age of cofﬁns, its schools closed, its places of public amusement closed, its 
Flip-ﬂap railroad closed. 
He stayed in bed for several more weeks, recuperating. The disease, he 
told his nephew, “seems to have localized itself in my intestinal, rather 
than the respiratory tract, which is probably fortunate.” He also insisted 
that his nephew, later a U.S. senator, make certain if any symptoms of 
inﬂuenza appeared at all in his family that the victim stay in bed “until 
the temperature has been normal for three days.” 
He had planned to attend a meeting on the disease at the Rockefeller 
Institute, but almost two weeks after arriving in Atlantic City, a month 
after ﬁrst becoming ill, he canceled; he had not recovered enough to 
attend. He would play no further role in medical science for the course of 
the epidemic. He would not participate in the search for a solution. He 
had of course done no laboratory work in years, but he had often proved 
an extraordinarily useful conduit, knowing everyone and everything, a 
cross-pollinator recognizing how the work of one investigator might 
complement the work of another, and directly or indirectly putting the 
two in touch. Now he would not play even that role. 
Coincidentally, both Flexner and Gorgas arrived in Europe on unre-
lated business just as inﬂuenza erupted in America. The generation who 
had transformed American medicine had withdrawn from the race. If 
anything was to be done in the nature of a scientiﬁc breakthrough, their 
spiritual descendants would do the doing. 
Welch had left Massachusetts with Burt Wolbach performing more 
autopsies, Milton Rosenau already beginning experiments on human vol-
unteers, and Oswald Avery beginning bacteriological investigations. Other 
outstanding scientists had also already engaged this problem—William 
Park and Anna Williams in New York, Paul Lewis in Philadelphia, Preston

Kyes in Chicago, and others. If the country was lucky, very lucky indeed, 
one of them might ﬁnd something soon enough to help. 
For all the urgency, investigators could not allow themselves to be pan-
icked into a disorderly approach. Disorder would lead nowhere. They 
began with what they knew and with what they could do. 
They could kill pathogens outside the body. An assortment of chemi-
cals could disinfect a room, or clothes, and they knew precisely the 
amount of chemicals needed and the duration of exposure necessary to 
fumigate a room. They knew how to disinfect instruments and materials. 
They knew how to grow bacteria, and how to stain bacteria to make them 
visible under microscopes. They knew that what Ehrlich called “magic 
bullets” existed that could kill infectious pathogens, and they even had 
started down the right pathways to ﬁnd them. 
Yet in the midst of crisis, with death everywhere, none of that knowl-
edge was useful. Fumigation and disinfecting required too much labor to 
work on a mass scale, and ﬁnding a magic bullet required discovering 
more unknowns than was then possible. Investigators quickly recognized 
they would get no help from materia medica. 
Medicine had, however, if not entirely mastered at least knew how to 
use one tool: the immune system itself. 
Investigators understood the basic principles of the immune system. 
They knew how to manipulate those principles to prevent and cure some 
diseases. They knew how to grow and weaken or strengthen bacteria in the 
laboratory, and how to stimulate an immune response in an animal. They 
knew how to make vaccines, and they knew how to make antiserum. 
They also understood the speciﬁcity of the immune system. Vaccines 
and antisera work only against the speciﬁc etiological agent, the speciﬁc 
pathogen or toxin causing the disease. Few investigators cared how ele-
gant their experiments were as friends, families, and colleagues fell ill. But 
to have the best hope of protecting with a vaccine or curing with a serum, 
investigators needed to isolate the pathogen. They needed to answer a 
ﬁrst question, the most important question—indeed, at this point the 
only question. What caused the disease? 
Richard Pfeiffer believed he had found the answer to that question a 
quarter century earlier. One of Koch’s most brilliant disciples, scientiﬁc

director of the Institute for Infectious Disease in Berlin, and a general in 
the German army, he was sixty years old in 1918 and by then had become 
somewhat imperious. Over his career he had addressed some of the great 
questions of medicine, and he had made enormous contributions. By any 
standard he was a giant. 
During and after the 1889–90 inﬂuenza pandemic—with the excep-
tion of 1918–19, the most severe inﬂuenza pandemic in the last three 
centuries—he had searched for the cause. Carefully, painstakingly, he had 
isolated tiny, slender, rod-shaped bacteria with rounded ends, although 
they sometimes appeared in somewhat different forms, from people suf-
fering from inﬂuenza. He often found the bacteria the sole organism 
present, and he found it in “astonishing numbers.” 
This bacteria clearly had the ability to kill, although in animals the dis-
ease produced did not quite resemble human inﬂuenza. Thus, the evidence 
against it did not fulﬁll “Koch’s postulates.” But human pathogens often 
either do not sicken animals or cause different symptoms in them, and 
many pathogens are accepted as the cause of a disease without fully satisfying 
Koch’s postulates. 
Pfeiffer was conﬁdent that he had found the cause of inﬂuenza. He 
even named the bacteria Bacillus inﬂuenzae. (Today this bacteria is called 
Hemophilus inﬂuenzae.) 
Among scientists the bacteria quickly became known as “Pfeiffer’s 
bacillus,” and, given his deserved reputation, few doubted the validity of 
his discovery. 
Certainty creates strength. Certainty gives one something upon which to 
lean. Uncertainty creates weakness. Uncertainty makes one tentative if 
not fearful, and tentative steps, even when in the right direction, may not 
overcome signiﬁcant obstacles. 
To be a scientist requires not only intelligence and curiosity, but passion, 
patience, creativity, self-sufﬁciency, and courage. It is not the courage 
to venture into the unknown. It is the courage to accept—indeed, 
embrace—uncertainty. For as Claude Bernard, the great French physiol-
ogist of the nineteenth century, said, “Science teaches us to doubt.” 
A scientist must accept the fact that all his or her work, even beliefs, 
may break apart upon the sharp edge of a single laboratory ﬁnding. And 
just as Einstein refused to accept his own theory until his predictions 
"
"262 
The Great Influenza 
were tested, one must seek out such ﬁndings. Ultimately a scientist has 
nothing to believe in but the process of inquiry. To move forcefully and 
aggressively even while uncertain requires a conﬁdence and strength 
deeper than physical courage. 
All real scientists exist on the frontier. Even the least ambitious among 
them deal with the unknown, if only one step beyond the known. The best 
among them move deep into a wilderness region where they know almost 
nothing, where the very tools and techniques needed to clear the wilder-
ness, to bring order to it, do not exist. There they probe in a disciplined 
way. There a single step can take them through the looking glass into a 
world that seems entirely different, and if they are at least partly correct their 
probing acts like a crystal to precipitate an order out of chaos, to create 
form, structure, and direction. A single step can also take one off a cliff. 
In the wilderness the scientist must create . . .  everything. It is grunt 
work, tedious work that begins with ﬁguring out what tools one needs 
and then making them. A shovel can dig up dirt but cannot penetrate 
rock. Would a pick then be best, or would dynamite be better—or would 
dynamite be too indiscriminately destructive? If the rock is impenetra-
ble, if dynamite would destroy what one is looking for, is there another 
way of getting information about what the rock holds? There is a stream 
passing over the rock. Would analyzing the water after it passes over the 
rock reveal anything useful? How would one analyze it? 
Ultimately, if the researcher succeeds, a ﬂood of colleagues will pave 
roads over the path laid, and those roads will be orderly and straight, tak-
ing an investigator in minutes to a place the pioneer spent months or 
years looking for. And the perfect tool will be available for purchase, just 
as laboratory mice can now be ordered from supply houses. 
Not all scientiﬁc investigators can deal comfortably with uncertainty, 
and those who can may not be creative enough to understand and design 
the experiments that will illuminate a subject—to know both where and 
how to look. Others may lack the conﬁdence to persist. Experiments do 
not simply work. Regardless of design and preparation, experiments— 
especially at the beginning, when one proceeds by intelligent guess-
work—rarely yield the results desired. An investigator must make them 
work. The less known, the more one has to manipulate and even force 
experiments to yield an answer. 
Which raises another question: How does one know when one knows? 
"
"The Race 
263 
In turn this leads to more practical questions: How does one know when 
to continue to push an experiment? And how does one know when to 
abandon a clue as a false trail? 
No one interested in any truth will torture the data itself, ever. But a 
scientist can—and should—torture an experiment to get data, to get a 
result, especially when investigating a new area. A scientist can—and 
should—seek any way to answer a question: if using mice and guinea pigs 
and rabbits does not provide a satisfactory answer, then trying dogs, pigs, 
cats, monkeys. And if one experiment shows a hint of a result, the slight-
est bump on a ﬂat line of information, then a scientist designs the 
next experiment to focus on that bump, to create conditions more likely 
to get more bumps until they become either consistent and meaningful 
or demonstrate that the initial bump was mere random variation with-
out meaning. 
There are limits to such manipulation. Even under torture, nature will 
not lie, will not yield a consistent, reproducible result, unless it is true. 
But if tortured enough, nature will mislead; it will confess to something 
that is true only under special conditions—the conditions the investiga-
tor created in the laboratory. Its truth is then artiﬁcial, an experimental 
artifact. 
One key to science is that work be reproducible. Someone in another 
laboratory doing the same experiment will get the same result. The result 
then is reliable enough that someone else can build upon it. The most 
damning condemnation is to dismiss a ﬁnding as “not reproducible.” 
That can call into question not only ability but on occasion ethics. 
If a reproducible ﬁnding comes from torturing nature, however, it is 
not useful. To be useful a result must not only be reproducible, it must 
be  . . . perhaps one should call it expandable. One must be able to enlarge 
it, explore it, learn more from it, use it as a foundation to build structures 
upon. 
These things become easy to discern in hindsight. But how does one 
know when to persist, when to continue to try to make an experiment 
work, when to make adjustments—and when ﬁnally to abandon a line of 
thought as mistaken or incapable of solution with present techniques? 
How does one know when to do either? 
The question is one of judgment. For the distinguishing element in 
science is not intelligence but judgment. Or perhaps it is simply luck.

George Sternberg did not pursue his discovery of the pneumococcus, and 
he did not pursue his discovery that white blood cells devoured bacteria. 
He did not because doing so would have deﬂected him from his unsuc-
cessful pursuit of yellow fever. Given his abilities, had he focused on 
either of those other discoveries, his name would be well known instead 
of forgotten in the history of science. 
Judgment is so difﬁcult because a negative result does not mean that 
a hypothesis is wrong. Nor do ten negative results, nor do one hundred 
negative results. Ehrlich believed that magic bullets existed; chemical 
compounds could cure disease. His reasoning led him to try certain com-
pounds against a certain infection. Ultimately he tried more than nine 
hundred chemical compounds. Each experiment began with hope. Each 
was performed meticulously. Each failed. Finally he found the compound 
that did work. The result was not only the ﬁrst drug that could cure an 
infection; it conﬁrmed a line of reasoning that led to thousands of inves-
tigators’ following the same path. 
How does one know when one knows? When one is on the edge one 
cannot know. One can only test. 
Thomas Huxley advised, “Surely there is a time to submit to guidance 
and a time to take one’s own way at all hazards.” 
Thomas Rivers was one of the young men from the Hopkins on the 
army’s pneumonia commission. He would later—only a few years later— 
deﬁne the differences between viruses and bacteria, become one of the 
world’s leading virologists, and succeed Cole as head of the Rockefeller 
Institute Hospital. He gave an example of the difﬁculty of knowing when 
one knows when he spoke of two Rockefeller colleagues, Albert Sabin and 
Peter Olitsky. As Rivers recalled, they “proved polio virus would grow 
only in nervous tissue. Elegant work, absolutely convincing. Everyone 
believed it.” 
Everyone believed it, that is, except John Enders. The virus Sabin and 
Olitsky were working with had been used in the laboratory so long that it 
had mutated. That particular virus would grow only in nervous tissue. 
Enders won a Nobel Prize for growing polio virus in other tissue, work 
that led directly to a polio vaccine. Sabin’s career was hardly ruined by his 
error; he went on to develop the best polio vaccine. Olitsky did well, too. 
But had Enders pursued his intuition and been wrong, much of his own 
career would have been utterly wasted.

Richard Pfeiffer insisted he had discovered the cause, the etiological 
agent, of inﬂuenza. His conﬁdence was so great he had even named it 
Bacillus inﬂuenzae. He had tremendous stature, half a rung below Pas-
teur, Koch, and Ehrlich. Surely his reputation stood higher than that of 
any American investigator before the war. Who would challenge him? 
His reputation gave his ﬁnding tremendous weight. Around the 
world, many scientists believed it. Indeed, some accepted it as an axiom: 
without the bacteria there could be no inﬂuenza. “No inﬂuenza bacilli 
have been found in cases here,” wrote one European investigator. There-
fore the disease was, he concluded, “not inﬂuenza.”

aboratories everywhere had turned to inﬂuenza. Pasteur’s pro-
tégé Émile Roux, one of those who had raced German competitors 
for a diphtheria antitoxin, directed the work at the Pasteur Institute. 
In Britain virtually everyone in Almroth Wright’s laboratory worked on 
it, including Alexander Fleming, whose later discovery of penicillin he 
ﬁrst applied to research on Pfeiffer’s so-called inﬂuenza bacillus. In Ger-
many, in Italy, even in revolution-torn Russia, desperate investigators 
searched for an answer. 
But by the fall of 1918 these laboratories could function only on a far-
reduced scale. Research had been cut back and focused on war, on poison 
gas or defending against it, on preventing infection of wounds, on ways 
to prevent diseases that incapacitated troops such as “trench fever,” an 
infection related to typhus that was not serious in itself but had taken 
more troops out of the line any other disease. Laboratory animals had 
become unavailable; armies consumed them for testing poison gas and 
similar purposes. The war had also sucked into itself technicians and 
young researchers. 
Laboratories in both Europe and the United States were affected, but 
Europeans suffered far more, with their work limited by shortages not 
only of people but of everything from coal for heat to money for petri 
dishes. At least those resources Americans had. And if the United States 
"
"The Race 
267 
still lagged behind Europe in the number of investigators, it no longer 
lagged in the quality of investigators. The Rockefeller Institute had 
already become arguably the best research institute in the world; out of a 
mere handful of scientists working there then, one man had already won 
the Nobel Prize and two would win it. In the most relevant area of work, 
in pneumonia, the Rockefeller Institute had a clear lead over the rest of 
the world. And Rockefeller scientists were hardly the only Americans 
doing world-class work. 
For Welch, Michigan’s Victor Vaughan, Harvard’s Charles Eliot, 
Penn’s William Pepper, and the handful of colleagues who had pushed so 
hard for change had succeeded. They had transformed American medical 
science. If that transformation had only just occurred, if it had only 
recently risen to the level of Europe, it also had the vitality that comes 
from recent conversion. And the nation at large was not so exhausted as 
Europe. It was not exhausted at all. 
As inﬂuenza stretched its ﬁngers across the country and began to 
crush out lives in its grip, virtually every serious medical scientist—and 
many simple physicians who considered themselves of scientiﬁc bent— 
began looking for a cure. They were determined to prove that science 
could indeed perform miracles. 
Most of them, simply, were not good enough to address the problem 
with any hope of success. They tried anyway. Their attempt was heroic. It 
required not just scientiﬁc ability but physical courage. They moved 
among the dead and dying, reached swabs into mouths and nasal pas-
sages of the desperately ill, steeped themselves in blood in the autopsy 
room, dug deep into bodies, and struggled to grow from swabbings, 
blood, and tissue the pathogen that was killing more humans than any 
other in history. 
A few of these investigators, possibly as few as a few dozen, were smart 
enough, creative enough, knowledgeable enough, skilled enough, and 
commanded enough resources that they were not on a fool’s errand. 
They could confront this disease with at least the hope of success. 
In Boston, Rosenau and Keegan continued to study the disease in the 
laboratory. The bulk of the army’s pneumonia commission had been 
ordered to Camp Pike, Arkansas, where, even as Welch arrived at Devens, 
they began investigating “a new bronchopneumonia.” The Rockefeller 
"
"268 
The Great Influenza 
team whom Welch had brought to Devens headed back to New York, 
where they added Martha Wollstein, a respected bacteriologist also asso-
ciated with the Rockefeller Institute, to the effort; she had studied the 
inﬂuenza bacillus since 1905. In Chicago at the Memorial Institute for 
Infectious Diseases, Ludwig Hektoen dove into the work. And at the 
Mayo Clinic, E. C. Rosenow did the same. The only civilian government 
research institution, the Public Health Service’s Hygienic Laboratory and 
its director George McCoy joined in. 
But of all those working on it in the United States, perhaps the most 
important were Oswald Avery at Rockefeller, William Park and Anna 
Williams at the New York City Department of Public Health, and Paul 
Lewis in Philadelphia. 
Each of them brought a different style to the problem, a different 
method of doing science. For Park and Williams, the work would come 
as close to routine as something could be in the midst of such extreme 
crisis; their efforts would have no impact on their own lives in any per-
sonal sense, although they would help direct research on inﬂuenza down 
the path that ultimately yielded the right answer. For Avery the work 
would conﬁrm him in a direction that he would follow for decades, 
decades ﬁrst of enormous frustration but then of momentous discovery— 
in fact a discovery that opened the door to an entire universe even now 
just beginning to be explored. For Lewis, although he could not have 
known it, his work on inﬂuenza would mark a turning point in his own 
life, one that would lead to a great tragedy, for science, for his family, and 
for himself. 
It was not a good time to confront a major new threat in the Bureau of 
Laboratories of the New York City Department of Public Health, the 
bureau Park ran and in which Williams worked. For they had a special 
problem: New York City politics. 
On January 1, 1918, Tammany Hall reclaimed control of the city. 
Patronage came ﬁrst. Hermann Biggs, the pioneer who had built the 
department, had left a year earlier to become state health commissoner; 
Biggs had been untouchable because he had treated a top Tammany 
leader who had protected the entire department during prior Tammany 
administrations. His successor was not untouchable. Mayor John Hylan 
"
"The Race 
269 
replaced him two weeks after taking control. But most jobs in the Depart-
ment of Health were not patronage positions, so to create vacancies Tam-
many began to smear the best municipal health department in the world. 
Soon Hylan demanded the ﬁring of division chiefs and the removal of 
highly respected physicians on the advisory board. 
Even the new Tammany-appointed health commissioner balked at 
that and resigned, leaving the department leaderless. The mayor was 
standing on the sidewalk outside City Hall when a crony introduced 
Royal Copeland to him, said he was a loyal Tammany man, and suggested 
the mayor name him the new health commissioner. But Copeland, dean 
of a homeopathic medical school, was not even an M.D. 
Nonetheless the mayor agreed to appoint him. The three men then 
climbed the steps to his ofﬁce, and Copeland was sworn in. 
The best municipal public health department in the world was now run 
by a man with no belief in modern scientiﬁc medicine and whose ambitions 
were not in public health but in politics. If Tammany wanted vacancies 
to ﬁll with loyalists, that is what he would give them. (Copeland once 
explained his loyalty to Tammany in simple terms: “Man is a social ani-
mal and cannot work without cooperation. Organization is a necessity 
and my organization is Tammany.” A few years later Tammany would 
repay his loyalty by carrying him to the United States Senate.) So he con-
tinued the machine’s efforts to disassemble the department. One of the 
best division heads was ﬁrst threatened with criminal charges and when 
that failed he was hauled to a civil-service hearing on charges of “neglect 
of duty, inefﬁciency, and incompetency.” 
Park had run the department’s laboratory division since 1893, had 
never involved himself in politics, and was himself untouchable. He con-
tinued to do excellent science in the midst of this turmoil; soon after 
Avery and Cole and others at Rockefeller developed their serum against 
Types I and II pneumococcus, Park developed a procedure for “typing” 
the pneumococcus so simple that any decent laboratory could perform it 
within thirty minutes, allowing nearly immediate use of the right serum 
for treatment. 
But now he had to defend the department. He helped organize a 
defense, and the defense became national. Criticism rained down on 
Tammany from the city, the state, from Baltimore, Boston, Washington. 
"
"270 
The Great Influenza 
Welch and nearly every major ﬁgure in medicine attacked Tammany. 
Rupert Blue, the head of the U.S. Public Health Service, publicly called 
upon the mayor to desist. 
Tammany backed off, and Copeland embarked on a public relations 
campaign to repair the damage to himself and his “organization,” relying 
on patriotism to stiﬂe criticism. By late summer the frenzy had died 
down, but what had been the best public health department in the world 
was demoralized. The internationally respected director of the Bureau of 
Public Health Education resigned. The deputy commissioner of health, 
in ofﬁce twenty years, resigned, and the mayor replaced him with his per-
sonal physician. 
On September 15, New York City’s ﬁrst inﬂuenza death occurred. By 
then the disease had long since begun leaking out of the army and navy 
bases into the civilian population of Massachusetts. 
In two polio epidemics in the preceding decade, public health ofﬁcials 
had all but closed down the city. But now Copeland did nothing. Three 
days later, as hospitals began ﬁlling with inﬂuenza cases, he made in-
ﬂuenza and pneumonia reportable diseases, while simultaneously stating 
that “other bronchial diseases and not the so-called Spanish inﬂuenza are 
said to be responsible for the illness of the majority of persons who were 
reported to be ill with inﬂuenza. . . .” 
A few days more and even Copeland could no longer deny reality. 
People could see disease all about them. Finally he imposed a quarantine 
on victims and warned, “The health department is prepared to compel 
patients who may be a menace to the community to go to hospitals.” He 
also assured all concerned “that the disease is not getting away from the 
control of the health department but is decreasing.” 
Park knew better. As a student in Vienna in 1890 he had watched that 
inﬂuenza pandemic kill one of his professors and wrote, “We mourn for 
him and for ourselves.” And for several months now he and others in his 
laboratory had followed the progress of the disease. He was well aware of 
the transformation of the City of Exeter into a ﬂoating morgue and of seri-
ous cases in July and August on ships arriving in New York harbor. Those 
cases did one good thing: they relieved the laboratory of political pres-
sure and allowed him and it to concentrate on work. 
In late August he and Anna Williams began devoting all their energies 
"
"The Race

to the disease. In mid-September they were called to Camp Upton in 
Long Island. The disease had just reached there, and few deaths had 
occurred—yet—but already a single barracks, ﬁlled with soldiers from 
Massachusetts, had two thousand cases. 
Park and Williams had collaborated now for a quarter of a century, 
and they complemented each other perfectly. He was a quiet brown-eyed 
man with a somewhat reserved, even aristocratic, bearing. He had a claim 
to the social elite; his father’s ancestors arrived in America in 1630, his 
mother’s in 1640. He also felt a calling. Three great-aunts had been mis-
sionaries and were buried in Ceylon, a cousin to whom he was very close 
became a minister, and Park himself had considered becoming a medical 
missionary. 
He had a serious purpose and curiosity per se did not drive that pur-
pose. His seeking of knowledge in the laboratory served his purpose only 
to the extent, as he saw it, that it served God’s purpose. He donated his 
salary as professor of bacteriology at New York University to the labora-
tory, or at least into the hands of some of his professional workers who 
struggled on city salaries. He also involved himself directly with patients, 
often working the diphtheria wards at the city-run Willard Parker Hospi-
tal across the street from his laboratory. The hospital was a new, gleam-
ing place, thirty-ﬁve iron bedsteads to each ward, with water closets and 
bathtubs of marble with porcelain lining, the polished hardwood ﬂoors 
washed every morning with a 1:1,000 solution of bichloride of mercury, 
the same solution in which patients themselves bathed at discharge and 
admission. 
Methodical, somewhat stolid, he was a master bureaucrat in the best 
sense of the word; he had run the health department’s Bureau of Labora-
tories for decades and had always looked for ways to make the system 
work. What drove him was the desire to bring laboratory research to 
patients. He was a pragmatist. Goethe observed that one searches where 
there is light. Some scientists try to create new light to shine on problems. 
Park was not one such; his forte was making exhaustive explorations with 
existing light. 
It was his and Williams’s work that had led to mass production of 
inexpensive diphtheria antitoxin. It was his work that had marked Amer-
ica’s acceptance as a scientiﬁc equal of Europe, when that international 
conference had endorsed his views on tuberculosis over Koch’s. His 
"
"272 
The Great Influenza 
scientiﬁc papers were exact if not quite elegant, and he matched his pre-
cision with a deeply probing and careful mind. 
It was that precision, and the missionary’s sense of right and wrong, 
that had led to his public feud over meningitis serum a few years earlier 
with Simon Flexner and the Rockefeller Institute. In 1911 Park had cre-
ated the Laboratory for Special Therapy and Investigation, at least in part 
to rival the Rockefeller Institute. He was a few years older now, but no 
mellower. He and Flexner remained “pretty acid” about each other, noted 
one scientist who knew them both well, with “no love lost between them,” 
but despite their animosity both of them cooperated with the other 
whenever called upon, and neither held back information. 
(This openness was a far cry from the atmosphere at some other lab-
oratories, including the Pasteur Institute. Pasteur himself had once 
advised a protégé not to share information with outsiders, saying, “Keep 
your cadavers to yourself.” When Anna Williams visited there, she was 
refused any information on a pneumonia antiserum until it was pub-
lished, and also had to promise that after she left, she would say nothing 
about anything else she had seen until it was published. Even in publica-
tion Pasteur scientists did not tell everything. As Biggs wrote Park, “Mar-
morek has taught her how it’s done—it is secret of course. In the usual 
way, he omitted the essential thing in his article.”) 
If Park was almost stolid, Anna Williams injected a certain wildness 
and creativity into the laboratory. She loved going up in airplanes with 
stunt ﬂiers—a reckless act in pre–World War I airplanes—and loved sud-
den fast turns and out-of-control drops. She loved to drive and was 
always speeding; when trafﬁc was stalled, she often simply pulled into the 
opposite side of the road and proceeded, and she had a string of trafﬁc 
tickets to prove it. Once she took a mechanic’s course and decided to take 
her Buick engine apart—but failed to put it back together. In her diary 
she wrote, “From my earliest memories, I was one of those who wanted 
to go places. When I couldn’t go, I would have my dreams about going. 
And, such wild dreams were seldom conceived by any other child.” 
Despite—or more likely because of—her wildness, she had estab-
lished herself as the premier woman medical scientist in America. Her 
achievement came at a price. 
She was unhappy. She was also lonely. At the age of forty-ﬁve, she 
wrote, “I was told today that it was quite pathetic that I had no one par-

"The Race

ticular friend.” She and Park had worked together for decades but they 
maintained a careful distance. To her diary she conﬁded, “There are 
degrees to everything, including friendship. . . .  [T]here is no sentimen-
tality about my friendships and little sentiment.” Religion gave her no 
relief. She wanted too much from it. She told herself that Jesus knew that 
his anguish was momentary and that in exchange he was going to save 
the world. “This knowledge . . . if  we were sure,  oh! what would we not be 
willing to undergo.” Of course she had no such knowledge. She could 
only recall “all the good things I have been taught . . .  [and] act as if they 
were true.” 
Yet in the end, although jealous of those who lived a normal life, she 
still preferred “discontent rather than happiness through lack of knowl-
edge.” Instead she did content herself with the fact that “I have had 
thrills.” Analyzing herself, she conﬁded in her diary that what mattered to 
her more were “love of knowledge,” “love of appreciation,” “love of win-
ning,” “fear of ridicule,” and “power to do, to think new things.” 
These were not Park’s motives, but she and Park made a powerful 
combination. In science, at least, she had had thrills indeed. 
She was ﬁfty-ﬁve years old in 1918. Park was the same age. There were 
no thoughts of thrills on the long drive and rough roads from Manhattan 
to Camp Upton, even though Park indulged her and let her drive. At the 
camp the military doctors, knowing what was happening at Devens, 
begged for advice. 
Park and Williams were experts on vaccine therapy. Even during the 
polio epidemics they had done excellent science, if only to prove the neg-
ative; Park had tried to develop but instead proved the ineffectiveness of 
several treatments. This time they felt hopeful; their work with strepto-
cocci and pneumococci, like that of the Rockefeller Institute’s, was prom-
ising. But as yet Park and Williams had no advice to give; they could only 
swab the throats and nasal passages of the sick at Upton, return to their 
laboratory, and proceed from there. 
They also got material from another source, which Williams never 
forgot. It was her ﬁrst inﬂuenza autopsy; the body was that of, she later 
wrote, “a ﬁne-looking youth from Texas” who shared her last name. She 
stood staring at his ﬁne features wondering about him, wondering even if 
he was some distant relative, and noting, “Death occurring so quickly it 
left little or no marks of disease anywhere except for the lungs.” 
"

The Great Influenza 
She could not have looked at his perfect form, perfect but for death, 
and not wondered just what the country was about to endure. The drive 
back to New York, the car ﬁlled with swabbings from mucosal mem-
branes, sputum, and tissue samples of a mysterious and lethal disease, 
likely alternated between intense conversation and silence, conversation 
as they planned their experiments and silence knowing the silence of the 
laboratory that awaited them. 
There was in fact nothing like Park’s laboratory in the world. From out-
side on the street, Park could look up with pride on the six-story build-
ing, the ﬂoors of laboratories, knowing that his successes had built them. 
Entirely dedicated to diagnostic testing, production of sera and antitox-
ins, and medical research, his creation sat at the foot of East Sixteenth 
Street with the teeming wharfs of the East River just beyond. 
Streetcars, horse-drawn carriages, and automobiles clattered past, 
and the smell of manure still mixed with that of gasoline and oil. There 
was all the sweat and ambition and failure and grit and money of New 
York City, all that made the city what it was and is. 
Inside the building Park oversaw a virtual industry. More than two 
hundred workers reported to him, nearly half of them scientists or tech-
nicians in one laboratory or another, each one with lab tables laid out in 
horizontal rows, gas burners in virtually constant use on each table, glass-
ware stacked on shelves above the tables as well as ﬁlling shelves along the 
walls, the rooms often hissing with steam and humidity from the auto-
claves used to sterilize. 
No other laboratory anywhere, not in any institute, not in any univer-
sity, not sponsored by any government, not run by any pharmaceutical 
company, had the combination of scientiﬁc competence, epidemiological 
and public health expertise, and ability to carry out directed research— 
to focus all resources on one question and not be deﬂected from that 
search no matter how enticing or important a ﬁnding might be—intent 
on immediate practical results. 
His laboratory could also function in extreme crisis. It had done so 
before: preventing outbreaks of cholera and typhoid, triumphing over 
diphtheria, helping in meningitis epidemics. It had done so not only in 
New York City but all over the country; when requested, Park had sent 
teams to ﬁght outbreaks of disease elsewhere. 
"
"The Race 
275 
And one other ability made the department unique. If a solution was 
found, it could produce serum and vaccines in industrial quantities as 
quickly as—and of better quality than—any drug manufacturer in the 
world. Indeed, it had been so successful making antitoxins that drug 
makers and city physicians had combined to use all their political power 
to limit that production. But now Park could quickly gear back up. 
Because of the assignment to produce serum for the army, he had just 
quadrupled the number of horses he could infect and then bleed. 
So it was not surprising that soon after Park returned from Camp 
Upton, he received a telegram from Richard Pearce, head of the National 
Research Council’s section on medicine. Pearce was grabbing at any infor-
mation he could get from the French, the British, even the Germans, and 
distributing it to investigators everywhere. He was also breaking the 
questions about inﬂuenza into pieces and asking each of a handful of 
investigators to focus on a single piece. From Park he wanted to know 
“the nature of the agent causing the so-called Spanish inﬂuenza . . .  
[and] pure cultures of the causative organism if obtainable. . . . Will your  
lab undertake the necessary bacteriological studies and make reports as 
quickly as possible to the undersigned?” 
Park instantly wired back, “Will undertake work.” 
It was as if the laboratory had gone to war, and Park was conﬁdent of 
victory. As he reviewed every published and unpublished scrap of data on 
the disease from laboratories around the world, he was unimpressed and 
dismissed most of it with near contempt. Certain his lab could do better, 
believing that others’ sloppiness at least partly contributed to their failure 
to understand the disease, he laid extraordinarily ambitious plans. In 
addition to ﬁnding the pathogen, in addition to ﬁnding a vaccine or 
serum or both, in addition to producing that drug in huge quantities, in 
addition to communicating to others the precise procedures to follow so 
they could produce it, he intended still more. He intended to make the 
most thorough study of any disease outbreak ever, selecting a large sam-
ple of people and, as many of them inevitably became ill, monitoring 
them through the most sophisticated possible laboratory and epidemio-
logical means. The workload would be enormous, but he believed that 
his department could handle it. 
But within days, almost within hours, the disease began to overwhelm 
"
"276 
The Great Influenza 
the department. Park had already compensated for the loss of labor to the 
war by analyzing every system and maximizing efﬁciency (installing, for 
example, a vacuum pump that in ﬁfteen minutes could ﬁll three thou-
sand tubes with individual vaccine doses), and even changing accounting 
methods. But now, as inﬂuenza struck ﬁrst one janitor or technician or 
scientist at a time, then four at a time, then ﬁfteen at a time, the labora-
tory reeled. Not so long before, when the Health Department had tracked 
a typhus outbreak to ground, four of his workers had died of typhus— 
most likely from laboratory infection. Now people in Park’s own lab were 
again sick, some dying. 
Inﬂuenza had humbled him, and quickly. He abandoned both his 
arrogance about the work of others and his own ambitious plans. Now he 
was trying to get just one thing right, the important thing. What was the 
pathogen? 
Meanwhile, the world seemed to shift underfoot. To Park and Wil-
liams and to others in other laboratories racing to ﬁnd an answer, it must 
have seemed as if they could see this great catastrophe approaching but 
had to remain frozen in place, all but incapable of doing anything to 
defeat or avoid it. It was almost as if one’s foot were caught under rocks 
in a tidal pool while the tide came in—the water rising to the knees, to 
the waist, one sucking in a deep breath then doubling over to try to pry 
one’s foot loose and straightening to feel the water at one’s neck, the swell 
of a wave passing over one’s head. . . .  
New York City was panicking, terriﬁed. 
By now Copeland was enforcing strict quarantines on all cases. There 
were literally hundreds of thousands of people sick simultaneously, many 
of them desperately sick. The death toll ultimately reached thirty-three 
thousand for New York City alone, and that understated the number con-
siderably since statisticians later arbitrarily stopped counting people as 
victims of the epidemic even though people were still dying of the disease 
at epidemic rates—still dying months later at rates higher than anywhere 
else in the country. 
It was impossible to get a doctor, and perhaps more impossible to get 
a nurse. Reports came in that nurses were being held by force in the 
homes of patients too frightened and desperate to allow them to leave. 
"
"The Race 
277 
Nurses were literally being kidnapped. It did not seem possible to put 
more pressure on the laboratory. Yet more pressure came. 
The pressure pushed Park to abandon more than his ambitious 
plans. He had always been meticulous, had never compromised, had 
built much of his scientiﬁc reputation on exposing the ﬂawed work of 
others, always moving forward carefully, basing his own experiments 
upon well-established premises and with as few assumptions as possible. 
“On the basis of experimental facts,” he had always said, “we are justiﬁed 
in . . .”  
Now Park had no leisure for justiﬁcation. If he was to have any impact 
on the course of the epidemic he would have to guess—and guess right. 
So those in his laboratory would, he reported, “study closely only the 
more dominant types that were demonstrated by our procedure. . . . We  
recognized that our methods . . .  did not take into account . . . heretofore 
undescribed organisms that might have an etiologic relationship to these 
infections.” 
The laboratory had only two constants. One was an endless supply of 
samples, of swabbings, blood, sputum, and urine from live patients and 
organs from the dead. “We had plenty of material, I am sorry to say,” 
Williams observed laconically. 
And they had their routine. Only the need to keep to discipline saved 
the laboratory from utter chaos. There was nothing even faintly exciting 
about this work; it was pure tedium, and pure boredom. And yet every 
step involved contact with something that could kill, and every step 
involved passion. Technicians took sputum samples from patients in the 
hospital and immediately—they could not wait even an hour, or bacteria 
from the patient’s mouth could penetrate into the sputum and contami-
nate it—began working with it. The steps began with “washing”: placing 
each small lump of balled mucus in a bottle of sterile water, removing it 
and repeating the process ﬁve times, then breaking up the mucus, wash-
ing it more, passing a platinum loop—a thin circle of platinum, like 
something one uses to blow bubbles—through it to transfer it to a test 
tube, taking another loop and repeating the step half a dozen times. Each 
step took time, time while people died, but they had no choice. They 
needed each step, needed to dilute the bacteria to prevent too many 
"
"278

colonies from growing in the same medium. Then they took more time, 
more steps, isolating each of these growths. 
Everything mattered. The most tedious tasks mattered. Washing 
glassware mattered. Contaminated glassware could ruin an experiment, 
waste time, cost lives. In the course of this work, 220,488 test tubes, bot-
tles, and ﬂasks would be sterilized. Everything mattered, and yet no one 
knew who would report to work each day, who would not—and who 
would suddenly be carried across the street to the hospital—and if some-
one failed to come into work it was nearly impossible to keep track of 
such simple jobs as removing growing cultures from incubators. 
There were dozens of ways to grow bacteria but often only one way to 
grow a particular kind. Some grow only without oxygen, others only with 
it in plentiful supply. Some require alkaline media, others acid. Some are 
extremely delicate, others stable. 
Every step, every attempt to grow the pathogen, meant effort, and 
effort meant time. Every hour incubating a culture meant time. They did 
not have time. 
Four days after accepting the task from Pearce, Park wired, “The only 
results so far that are of real importance have been obtained in two fatal 
cases, one a man coming from Brooklyn Navy Yard and one a doctor 
from the naval hospital in Boston. Both developed an acute septic pneu-
monia and died within a week of the onset of the ﬁrst infection. In both 
cases the lungs showed a beginning pneumonia and in smears very abun-
dant streptococci. . . . There were  absolutely no inﬂuenza bacilli in either 
of the lungs.” 
The failure to ﬁnd the “inﬂuenza bacillus” maddened Park. His best 
hope to produce a vaccine or serum would be to ﬁnd a known pathogen, 
and the most likely suspect was the one Pfeiffer had named Bacillus inﬂuen-
zae. Pfeiffer had been and still was conﬁdent it caused the disease. Park 
would not hesitate to rule B. inﬂuenzae out if he did not ﬁnd good evidence 
for it, but he had the utmost respect for Pfeiffer. Working in these des-
perate circumstances, he wanted to conﬁrm rather than reject Pfeiffer’s 
work. He wanted the answer to be Pfeiffer’s bacillus. That would give them 
a chance, a chance to produce something that saved thousands of lives. 
B. inﬂuenzae was a particularly difﬁcult bacteria to isolate. It is tiny, 
even by the standards of bacteria, and usually occurs singly or in pairs 
rather than in large groups. It requires particular factors, including blood, 
"
"The Race 
279 
in culture medium for it to grow. It grows only within a very narrow 
range of temperatures, and its colonies are minute, transparent, and 
without structure. (Most bacteria form distinctive colonies with a partic-
ular shape and color, distinctive enough that they can sometimes be 
identiﬁed just by looking at the colony in the same way that some ants 
can be identiﬁed by the form of their anthill.) B. inﬂuenzae grows only on 
the surface of the medium, since it depends heavily upon oxygen. It is 
also difﬁcult to stain, hence difﬁcult to see under the microscope. It is an 
easy target to miss unless one is speciﬁcally looking for it and unless one 
uses excellent technique. 
While others in the lab searched for other organisms, Park asked 
Anna Williams to concentrate on ﬁnding Pfeiffer’s. Anna Williams found 
it. She found it constantly. Ultimately, once she perfected her technique, 
she would ﬁnd it in 80 percent of all samples from the Willard Parker 
Hospital, in every single sample from the Marine Hospital, in 98 percent 
of the samples from the Home for Children. 
As much as he wanted Williams to be right, he would not let his desire 
corrupt his science. He went a step further, to “the most delicate test of 
identity . . . agglutination.” 
“Agglutination” refers to a phenomenon in which antibodies in a test 
tube bind to the antigen of the bacterium and form clumps, often large 
enough to be visible to the naked eye. 
Since the binding of antibodies to an antigen is speciﬁc, since the anti-
bodies to the inﬂuenza bacillus will bind to only that bacteria and to no 
other, it is a precise conﬁrmation of identity. The agglutination tests proved 
without doubt that Williams had found Pfeiffer’s inﬂuenza bacillus. 
Less than a week after ﬁrst reporting his failure to ﬁnd it, Park wired 
Pearce that B. inﬂuenzae “would seem to be the starting point of the dis-
ease.” But he was well aware that his methods had been less than thor-
ough, adding, “There is of course the possibility that some unknown 
ﬁlterable virus may be the starting point.” 
The report had consequences. Park’s laboratory began the struggle to 
produce an antiserum and vaccine to Pfeiffer’s bacillus. Soon they were 
culturing liters and liters of the bacteria, transporting it north, and 
injecting it into the horses on the Health Department’s 175-acre farm 
sixty-ﬁve miles north of the city. 
"
"280 
The Great Influenza 
But the only way to know for certain that B. inﬂuenzae caused the dis-
ease was to follow Koch’s postulates: isolate the pathogen, use it to re-
create the disease in an experimental animal, and then re-isolate the 
pathogen from the animal. The bacillus did kill laboratory rats. But their 
symptoms did not resemble inﬂuenza. 
The results, suggestive as they were, did not fully satisfy Koch’s postu-
lates. In this case the necessary experimental animal was man. 
Human experiments had begun. In Boston, Rosenau and Keegan 
were already trying to give the disease to volunteers from a navy brig. 
None of the volunteer subjects had yet gotten sick. One of the doctors 
conducting the study did. In fact he died of inﬂuenza. In a scientiﬁc 
sense, however, his death demonstrated nothing.

hile Park tried to produce an antiserum or vaccine against the 
disease in New York, Philadelphia was already approaching collapse. 
Its experience would soon be echoed in many cities around the country. 
There Paul Lewis was searching for the answer as well. Few, including 
Park, were more likely to ﬁnd it. The son of a physician, Lewis grew up in 
Milwaukee, went to the University of Wisconsin, and ﬁnished his medical 
training at Penn in 1904. Even before leaving medical school he knew he 
intended to spend his life in the laboratory, and he quickly acquired both 
a pedigree and a well-deserved reputation. He started as a junior investi-
gator working on pneumonia under Welch, Osler, Biggs, and several oth-
ers who comprised the Rockefeller Institute’s Board of Scientiﬁc Advisers. 
Lewis impressed them all. Most impressed was Theobald Smith, one of 
the world’s leading bacteriologists, for whom Lewis then worked in 
Boston. Later Smith recommended Lewis to Simon Flexner, saying that 
Harvard lacked the resources to allow Lewis to develop fully and that 
“[h]is heart lies in research.” 
From Smith there could come no higher compliment. Lewis deserved 
it. He seemed born for the laboratory. At least that was the only place where 
he was happy; he loved not only the work itself but the laboratory environ-
ment, loved disappearing into the laboratory and into thought. “Love” 
was not too strong a word; his passions lay in the lab. At Rockefeller, 
Lewis had started off pursuing his own ideas but when a polio epidemic 
"
"282 
The Great Influenza 
erupted Flexner asked him to work with him on it. He agreed. It was a 
perfect match. Their polio work was a model combination of speed and 
good science. They not only proved that polio was a viral disease, still con-
sidered a landmark ﬁnding in virology, but they developed a vaccine that 
protected monkeys from polio 100 percent of the time. It would take nearly 
half a century to develop a polio vaccine for humans. In the course of this 
research Lewis became one of the leading experts in the world on viruses. 
Flexner pronounced Lewis “one of the best men in the country, . . . a  
very gifted fellow.” That may have been an understatement. Richard 
Shope worked closely with him in the 1920s, knew many of the world’s 
best scientists (including Flexner, Welch, Park, Williams, and many Nobel 
laureates)—and himself became a member of the National Academy of 
Sciences. He called Lewis the smartest man he ever knew. Joseph Aron-
son, a prize-winning University of Pennsylvania scientist who had also 
done research at the Pasteur Institute, named his son after Lewis and, like 
Shope, said Lewis was the brightest man he had ever met. 
When the war began, Pearce, the National Research Council ofﬁcial, 
told Lewis what he told only four or ﬁve other scientists in the country: to 
expect to be asked “for special service in connection with epidemic disease.” 
Lewis was ready. He received a navy commission and told Flexner he 
had “no onerous routine duties.” His laboratory abilities were far more 
important. He was still cooperating with Cole and Avery on the develop-
ment of pneumonia serum, and he was also, as he told Flexner, experi-
menting with dyes “as regards their capacity to inhibit the growth” of the 
bacteria that cause tuberculosis. The idea that dyes might kill bacteria 
was not original with him, but he was doing world-class work in the area 
and his instincts were right about its importance. Twenty years later a 
Nobel Prize would go to Gerhard Domagk for turning a dye into the ﬁrst 
antibiotic, the ﬁrst of the sulfa drugs. 
But now the city did not need laboratory breakthroughs that deep-
ened understanding. It needed instant successes. Lewis had reached his 
conclusions about polio with tremendous speed—roughly a year, and 
they had been both sound and pioneering conclusions. But now he had 
only weeks, even days. Now he was watching bodies literally pile up in the 
hospital morgue at the Navy Yard, in the morgues of civilian hospitals, in 
undertaking establishments, in homes. 
"
"The Race 
283 
He remembered Flexner’s work on meningitis during an epidemic of 
that disease. Flexner had solved that problem and the success had made 
the reputation of the Rockefeller Institute. Knowing that Flexner had 
succeeded then made a solution to this seem possible. Perhaps Lewis 
could do the same. 
He considered whether a ﬁlter-passing organism caused inﬂuenza. 
But to look for a virus Lewis would have to look in darkness. That was 
science, the best of science—at least to look into the gloaming was—but 
he was not now engaged only in science. Not right now. He was trying to 
save lives now. 
He had to look where there was light. 
First, light shone on a kind of blunt-force use of the immune system. 
Even if they could not ﬁnd the pathogen, even if they could not follow 
normal procedures and infect horses with the pathogen and then prepare 
the blood from horses, there was one animal that was suffering from the 
disease that was scorching its way across the earth. That animal was man. 
Most people who contracted the disease survived. Even most people 
who contracted pneumonia survived. It was quite possible that their 
blood and their serum held antibodies that would cure or prevent disease 
in others. Lewis and Flexner had had some success using this approach 
with polio in 1910. In Boston, Dr. W. R. Redden at the navy hospital also 
remembered, as he reported, “the experimental evidence presented by 
Flexner and Lewis with convalescent serum from poliomyelitis.” Now 
Redden and a colleague drew blood from those who had survived an 
inﬂuenza attack, extracted the serum, and injected it into thirty-six pneu-
monia patients in a row, beginning October 1. This was not a scientiﬁc 
experiment with controls, and in a scientiﬁc sense the results proved 
nothing. But by the time they reported the results in the October 19 
JAMA, thirty patients had recovered, ﬁve were still undergoing treat-
ment, and only one had died. 
Experiments began in Philadelphia using both the whole blood and 
serum of survivors of inﬂuenza as well. These too were not scientiﬁc 
experiments; they were desperate attempts to save lives. If there was any 
sign this procedure worked, the science could follow later. 
Lewis let others conduct that blunt-force work. It took no truly spe-
cial skills, and others could do it as well as he. He spent his time on four 
"
"284 
The Great Influenza 
things. He did not do these things sequentially. He did them simultane-
ously, moving down different paths—setting up experiments to test each 
hypothesis—at the same time. 
First, he tried to develop an inﬂuenza vaccine using the same methods 
he had used against polio. This was a more sophisticated version of the 
blunt-force approach of transfusing the blood or serum of inﬂuenza sur-
vivors. For he at least suspected a virus might cause inﬂuenza. 
Second, he stayed in the laboratory following a shimmer of light. As 
Park had reasoned, so Lewis reasoned. Research could ﬁnd bacteria. 
Pfeiffer had already pointed an accusing ﬁnger at one bacillus. Lewis and 
everyone in his laboratories were working hours and days without relief, 
taking only a few hours off for sleep, running procedure after procedure— 
agglutination, ﬁltration, transferring culture growths, injecting labora-
tory animals. His team too searched for bacteria. They took more swabs 
from the throats and noses of the ﬁrst victims, exposed the medium to it, 
and waited. They worked intensively, twenty-four hours a day in shifts, 
and then they waited, frustrated by the time it took bacteria to grow in 
the cultures, frustrated by the number of cultures that became contami-
nated, frustrated by everything that interfered with their progress. 
In the ﬁrst ﬁfteen cases, Lewis found no B. inﬂuenzae. Ironically, the 
disease had exploded so quickly, spreading to hospital staff, that Lewis had 
little except sputum samples to work with: “The hospitals were so depleted 
[of staff] . . . I have  had no autopsy material” except from four “badly 
decomposed” bodies, almost certainly too long dead to be of any use. 
Then, like Park and Williams, Lewis adjusted his techniques and did 
begin to ﬁnd the bacillus regularly. He gave this information to Krusen, 
the health commissioner. The Inquirer and other newspapers, desperate 
to say something positive, declared that he had found the cause of 
inﬂuenza and “armed the medical profession with absolute knowledge 
on which to base their campaign against the disease.” 
Lewis had no such absolute knowledge, nor did he believe he had it. 
True, he had isolated B. inﬂuenzae. But he had also isolated a pneumo-
coccus and a hemolytic streptococcus. Some instinct pointed him 
another direction. He began third and fourth lines of inquiry. The third 
involved shifting his dye experiments from trying to kill tuberculosis bac-
teria to trying to kill pneumococci. 
But death surrounded him, enveloped him. He turned his attention 
"
"The Race 
285 
back to helping produce the only thing that might work now. After the 
emergency, if anything seemed to work he could always return to the lab-
oratory and do careful, deliberate experimentation to understand it and 
prove its effectiveness. 
So he chose as his targets the bacteria he and others had found. From 
the ﬁrst instant he had seen the dying sailors, he had known he would 
have to begin work on it now. For even if he had guessed right, even if 
what he was doing could succeed, it would take time to succeed. So, in his 
laboratory and in other laboratories around the city, the investigators no 
longer investigated. They simply tried to produce. There was no certainty 
that anything they produced would work. There was only hope. 
He started by preparing medium using beef peptone broth with 
blood added, and then growing cultures of the pathogens they had iso-
lated from cases—B. inﬂuenzae, Types I and II of the pneumococcus, and 
hemolytic streptococcus. He personally prepared small batches of vac-
cine including these organisms and gave it to sixty people. Of those sixty, 
only three people developed pneumonia and none died. A control group 
had ten pneumonias and three deaths. 
This seemed more than just promising. It was not proof. Many factors 
could explain the results, including random chance. But he could not 
wait for explanations. 
His laboratory had no ability to produce the immense quantities of 
vaccine needed. It required an industrial operation. They needed vats to 
grow these things in, not petri dishes or laboratory ﬂasks. They needed 
vats like those in a brewery. 
He handed off this task to others in the city, including those who ran 
the municipal laboratory. It would take time to grow enough for tens of 
thousands of people. 
The whole process, even in its most accelerated state, would take at 
least three weeks. And it would take time once they made the vaccine to 
administer it to thousands and thousands of people in a series of injec-
tions of increasing doses spaced several days apart. In all that time, the 
disease would be killing. 
Meanwhile, Lewis began work on still a ﬁfth line of inquiry, making 
a serum that could cure the disease. This work was trickier. They could 
make a vaccine with a shotgun approach, combining several organisms 
and protecting against all of them. (Today vaccines against diphtheria, 
"
"286 
The Great Influenza 
pertussis—whooping cough—and tetanus are combined in a single shot; 
a single shot protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella is routinely 
given to children; and today’s ﬂu shots contain vaccines against both the 
inﬂuenza virus and pneumococci—and the pneumococcal vaccine is a 
descendant of the work done at Rockefeller Institute in 1917.) 
A serum had to aim at only one speciﬁc target; if it worked at all, it 
would work only against a single organism. To make a serum that 
worked, Lewis would have to pick a single target. If he had to aim at a sin-
gle target, he had to choose the bacillus Pfeiffer had discovered, B. 
inﬂuenzae. It was still by far the most likely cause of the disease. 
Developing a serum against this organism would likely be difﬁcult. 
While Lewis was still at the Rockefeller Institute, Flexner himself had 
tried to do this in collaboration with Martha Wollstein. Wollstein—a ﬁne 
scientist, although Flexner never treated her with the respect he gave to 
others—had experimented with B. inﬂuenzae almost continuously since 
1906. But Flexner and she had made no progress whatsoever. They had 
not only failed to develop a serum that could help man; they had failed to 
cure any laboratory animals. 
Lewis never understood precisely where Flexner had gone wrong in 
that attempt, although it certainly would have been the subject of many 
talks in the famous lunchroom where solutions to so many scientiﬁc 
problems were suggested. Now he had no opportunity to think deeply 
about the problem, think all the way through it, come up with a hypoth-
esis with explanatory power, and test it. 
Lewis could only hope that Flexner failed because his technique was 
faulty. That was quite possible. Flexner had sometimes been a little 
sloppy in the laboratory. He had once even conceded, “Technically, I am 
not well-trained in the sense of meticulous and complete accuracy.” 
So now Lewis hoped some technical error—perhaps in the prepara-
tion of the medium, perhaps in too rough a usage for the killed bacteria, 
perhaps somewhere else—accounted for Flexner’s problems. It might 
have. For example, many years later a young graduate student entered a 
laboratory and saw a renowned Harvard professor at the sink washing 
glassware while his technician was perfoming a complex task at the work-
bench. The student asked him why the technician was not washing the 
glassware. “Because,” the professor replied, “I always do the most impor-
"
"The Race 
287 
tant part of the experiment and in this experiment the most important 
thing is the cleanliness of the glassware.” 
Lewis turned all his attention in effect to washing the glassware, to the 
most mundane tasks, making certain there would no mistakes in the 
work itself, at the same time applying any knowledge about Pfeiffer’s 
bacillus that had been learned since Flexner’s failure. 
Lewis knew full well that little of what he was doing was good science. 
It was all, or nearly all, based on informed guesswork. He only worked 
harder. 
As he worked, the society about him teetered on the edge of collapse.

hen Welch had ﬁrst seen autopsies of victims at Devens he had 
walked out of the morgue and made three calls: to a Harvard 
pathologist, asking him to conduct further autopsies; to Gorgas’s ofﬁce, 
warning of the coming of an epidemic; and to Oswald Avery at the Rock-
efeller Institute, asking him to get on the next train from New York. He 
hoped Avery could identify the pathogen killing the men at Devens. 
Avery immediately left his own lab, walked the few blocks home for a 
change of clothes, then went to Pennsylvania Station, that magniﬁcent 
and uplifting building. For the length of his train ride through the Con-
necticut countryside, through the teeming train stations of New Haven, 
Providence, and Boston, up to Devens, he began to prepare, reviewing 
the best approaches to this problem. 
Welch had told him of his concern that, despite clinical symptoms 
that looked like inﬂuenza, this might be a new disease. Avery’s ﬁrst step 
would still be to look for the presence of B. inﬂuenzae, everyone’s chief 
suspect as the cause of inﬂuenza. Avery knew a fair amount about Pfeif-
fer’s bacillus, including that it was exceptionally difﬁcult to grow and that 
its chemistry made it difﬁcult to stain and hence see in a smear under the 
microscope. The chemistry and metabolism of the bacteria interested 
him. He wondered how to make it grow better, how to make it easier to 
ﬁnd, how to make it easier to identify. For he always did everything, down 
to washing the glassware, with precision and discipline. 
"
"The Race 
289 
Late that afternoon Avery arrived at the camp and immediately began 
laboratory tests. He was all but impervious to the chaos about him, 
impervious to the bodies of young men lying naked or in bloody sheets 
he had to step over—as Welch, Cole, Vaughan, Russell, and the others of 
that party had—to reach the autopsy room. 
From the ﬁrst he encountered difﬁculties, getting puzzling results 
from the Gram test. In this test, bacteria are stained with crystal violet, 
treated with iodine, washed with alcohol, and then stained again with a 
contrasting dye. Bacteria retaining the violet color are called “Gram-
positive.” Those that do not are “Gram-negative.” The result of the Gram 
test is comparable to a witness identifying an assailant as white or black; 
the answer simply eliminates some possible suspects. 
Unlike other investigators, Avery found no Gram-negative bacteria. B. 
inﬂuenzae is Gram-negative. The test eliminated B. inﬂuenzae as even a 
possibility. It eliminated all Gram-negative bacteria as possibilities. He 
repeated the experiment; again he found no Gram-negative bacteria, 
none at all. 
Avery soon solved this particular puzzle. He discovered that all the 
liquid in the laboratory bottles labeled “alcohol” was actually water. Sol-
diers had apparently drunk the alcohol and replaced it with water. When he 
got alcohol, the test results came in as expected. He found Gram-negative 
bacteria. 
Now he began his hunt in earnest. He began it with dead bodies, those 
of the men who had died most recently, some of whom so recently that 
their bodies remained warm to the touch. He felt the soggy sponginess of 
the still-warm lungs and respiratory tract with his gloved hands, seeking 
out areas of the most obvious infection from which to cut tissue samples, 
dipping into pockets of pus, seeking the organism responsible for the 
killing. Perhaps he was a little afraid, this tiny man surrounded by dead 
young soldiers, but he had courage and he was not hunting rabbits. He 
had no interest in hunting rabbits. 
Smears across slides turned up several possible pathogens, all of them 
potential killers. He needed to know which one did the killing. 
He stayed at Devens long enough to grow cultures of bacteria. Like 
Park and Lewis, Avery had initial difﬁculty but began to ﬁnd Pfeiffer’s 
bacillus. He discovered it in twenty-two of thirty dead soldiers and gave 
Welch his results. Meanwhile Burt Wolbach, the Harvard pathologist 
"
"290 
The Great Influenza 
whom Welch had also asked to help at Devens, made a stronger statement: 
“Every case showed the inﬂuenza bacillus, in many instances pure cul-
tures  from  one  or  more  lobes. . . . Mixed  cultures, usually pneumococ-
cus, where bronchial dilation was marked. . . . Pure  cultures of inﬂuenza 
bacillus in the more recent stages and therefore usually in the upper 
lobes.” In an article in Science, another respected investigator also wrote, 
“The causative agent is believed to be the bacillus of Pfeiffer.” 
On September 27, Welch, Cole, and Victor Vaughan wired the sur-
geon general from Devens, “It is established that the inﬂuenza at Camp 
Devens is caused by the bacillus of Pfeiffer.” 
But it was not so established, at least not to Avery. Although he 
respected Wolbach, not to mention Park, Williams, and Lewis, all of 
whom were reaching the same conclusion at about the same time, he 
based conclusions only upon his own ﬁndings. And his ﬁndings did not 
convince him yet. In seven of the autopsies he found no sign of any bac-
terial invasion whatsoever, despite the devastation of the lungs. Also, 
although he found potentially lethal bacteria without any sign of Pfeif-
fer’s in only a single instance, in roughly half the cases he was ﬁnding 
both Pfeiffer’s and other organisms, including the pneumococcus, hemo-
lytic streptococcus, and staphylococcus aureus, which although a lethal 
organism rarely caused pneumonia. 
He could interpret these ﬁndings several ways. They might mean that 
Pfeiffer’s B. inﬂuenzae did not cause the disease. But that was only one 
possible conclusion. Pfeiffer’s might well be the cause of the disease, and, 
after it infected the victim, other bacteria took advantage of a weakened 
immune system to follow its lead. This would not be unusual. Finding sev-
eral pathogens might even actually strengthen the case for Pfeiffer’s. Pfeif-
fer’s grew poorly in laboratory cultures whenever other bacteria, especially 
the pneumococcus or hemolytic streptococcus, were also present. So its 
existence at all in cultures with these other organisms might indicate that 
B. inﬂuenzae had been present in enormous numbers in the victim. 
Methodically he ran through all this in his mind. By early October, 
he was back at Rockefeller hearing reports from dozens of other inves-
tigators around the country and the world that they too were ﬁnding 
the inﬂuenza bacillus. But there were also reports of failures to ﬁnd B. 
inﬂuenzae. It would be easy to dismiss the failures to ﬁnd it as failures of 
technique; Pfeiffer’s was after all one of the most difﬁcult organisms to 
"
"The Race 
291 
grow. Still, Avery’s own ﬁndings alone left too many unanswered ques-
tions for him to reach a conclusion, crisis or not. Unlike Park, Williams, 
and Lewis, Avery was not ready to reach even a tentative conclusion. Yes, 
Pfeiffer’s might cause inﬂuenza. Oh yes it might. But he was not con-
vinced. From Avery came no reports of ﬁnding inﬂuenza’s cause, no 
phone calls or telegrams that he was sending cultures with which to 
infect horses and produce serum or vaccine. 
He was pushing himself harder than he ever had at Devens—and he 
always pushed hard. He ate in the laboratory, ran dozens of experiments 
simultaneously, barely slept, bounced ideas by telephone off Rosenau and 
others. He bore into his experiments like a drill, breaking them apart and 
examining every fractured crack in the data for a clue. But if he pushed 
himself to work, he would not push himself toward a conclusion. 
He was not convinced. 
Oswald Avery was different. Pressure troubled him less than having to 
force the direction of his work, and that he could not pursue the trail 
wherever it led, could not move at his own pace, could not take the time 
to think. Make-do solutions were foreign to his nature. He worked on the 
vertical. He dove deeply into a thing, to the deepest depths, following 
down the narrowest pathways and into the tiniest openings, leaving no 
loose ends. In every way his life was vertical, focused, narrow, controlled. 
He prepared . . .  everything, wanting to control every effect. Even the 
drafts of his rare talks show marks denoting what words to emphasize, 
where to change the tone of his voice, where to use nuance. Even in casual 
conversation it sometimes seemed each word, indeed each hesitation, 
was carefully prepared, weighed, and perhaps staged. His personal ofﬁce, 
adjacent to his laboratory, reﬂected focus as well. René Dubos, a promi-
nent scientist, called it “small and bare, as empty as possible, without 
the photographs, mementos, pictures, unused books, and other friendly 
items that usually adorn and clutter a work place. The austerity symbol-
ized how much he had given up all aspects of his life for the sake of utter 
concentration on a few chosen goals.” 
For in digging deep, Avery did not wish to be disturbed. He was not 
rude or unkind or ungenerous. Far from it. Young investigators who 
worked under him uniformly became his most loyal admirers. But he 
burrowed in, deeper and deeper into the world of his own making, a 
"
"292 
The Great Influenza 
world—however narrow—that he could deﬁne and over which exert 
some control. 
But narrow did not mean small. There was nothing small about his 
thinking. He used information like a springboard, a jumping-off point that 
allowed his mind to roam freely, indeed to race freely—even carelessly— 
to speculate. Colin MacLeod, like Dubos a brilliant Avery protégé, said 
that whenever an experiment yielded unexpected information Avery’s 
“imagination was now ﬁred. . . . He would explore theoretical implica-
tions exhaustively.” 
Dubos put it another way. He believed Avery uncomfortable in and 
possibly incapable of handling the chaos of social interaction. But he 
believed Avery comfortable with and capable of confronting the chaos of 
nature. Avery could do so because of his “uncanny sense of what was 
truly important” and “imaginative vision of reality. . . . He  had the cre-
ative impulse to compose those facts into meaningful and elegant struc-
tures. . . . His  scientiﬁc compositions had, indeed, much in common 
with artistic creations which do not imitate actuality but transcend it and 
illuminate reality.” 
Years after the pandemic, Avery’s colleague and friend Alphonse 
Dochez received the Kober Medal, an award Avery himself had received 
earlier. In a tribute, Avery described Dochez’s work ethic. He could 
have been describing his own: “[R]esults . . . are  not random products of 
chance observations. They are the fruit of years of wise reﬂection, objec-
tive thinking, and thoughtful experimentation. I have never seen his lab-
oratory desk piled high with Petri dishes and bristling with test tubes like 
a forest wherein the trail ends and the searcher becomes lost in dense 
thickets of confused thought. . . . I have never known  him to engage in 
purposeless rivalries or competitive research. But often have I seen him 
sit calmly, lost in thought, while all around him others with great show of 
activity were ﬂitting about like particles in Brownian motion; then, I have 
watched him rouse himself, smilingly saunter to his desk, assemble a few 
pipettes, borrow a few tubes of media, perhaps a jar of ice, and then do a 
simple experiment which answered the question.” 
But now, in the midst of a killing epidemic, everything and everyone 
around him—including even the pressure from Welch—shouldered 
thought aside, shouldered perspective and preparation aside, substitut-
ing for it what Avery so disdained: Brownian motion—the random 
"
"The Race 
293 
movement of particles in a ﬂuid. Others hated inﬂuenza for the death it 
caused. Avery hated it for that, too, but for a more personal assault as 
well, an assault upon his integrity. He would not yield to it. 
When Avery experimented, a colleague said, “His attitude had many 
similarities with the hunter in search of his prey. For the hunter, all the 
components—the rocks, the vegetation, the sky—are fraught with infor-
mation and meanings that enable him to become part of the intimate 
world of his prey.” Avery had a hunter’s patience. He could lie in wait, for 
an hour, a day, a week, a month, a season. If the prey mattered enough, he 
could wait through an entire season and then another and then another. 
But he did not simply wait; he wasted not a single hour, he plotted, he 
observed, he learned. He learned his prey’s escape routes and closed them 
off; he found better and better vantage points; he bracketed the ﬁeld 
through which the prey passed and kept tightening that ﬁeld until, even-
tually, the prey had to pass through a noose. And he could lay traps: 
studying pneumococci by scratching it into the skin, for example, where 
the immune system could easily control the infection, but which still gave 
him the opportunity to experiment with the bacteria outside a test tube. 
He advised, “Whenever you fall, pick up something.” And he often said, 
“Disappointment is my daily bread. I thrive on it.” 
He would not be rushed. There was pressure on him, pressure on 
everyone. But he would not be rushed. At Rockefeller he was hardly the 
only one devoting all his energies to inﬂuenza. Martha Wollstein, who 
had years before collaborated with Flexner on an unsuccessful effort to 
develop a serum for Pfeiffer’s, was searching for antibodies in the blood 
of recovered patients. Dochez was making an intensive study of throats. 
Many others were working on the disease. But they had made little 
progress. Rufus Cole reported to Gorgas’s ofﬁce in mid-October, “We 
have been compelled to take care of the cases of inﬂuenza arising in the 
Hospital and Institute and these patients have occupied all of our space.” 
Because of the time treating the patients took, he added, “I do not think 
we can add very much, so far, to the knowledge concerning the disease.” 
Everywhere the pressure was intense. Eugene Opie, another Hopkins 
product who was now a lieutenant colonel on the army’s pneumonia 
commission, had been at Camp Pike in Arkansas when the epidemic 
broke out. He had gone there because, during the measles epidemic, Pike 
"
"294 
The Great Influenza 
had had the highest rate of pneumonia of any cantonment in the coun-
try. Now of course his orders were to work entirely on inﬂuenza. Freder-
ick Russell, speaking for Gorgas, demanded “daily . . . a  statement of your 
ﬁndings, as you interpret them.” Every day he was to report. If he found 
anything that gave the faintest hint of progress, Gorgas wanted to know 
it—instantly—so it could be shared. Opie would ﬁnd no shortage of 
experimental material. Camp Pike held sixty thousand troops. At the 
crest of the epidemic thirteen thousand of them would be hospitalized 
simultaneously. 
Investigators struggled to ﬁnd something—anything—that could 
help, that could contain the explosion. Though no one had found any-
thing certain, in Philadelphia following Lewis’s methods, in New York 
following Park’s, in Chicago following those developed at the Mayo 
Clinic, laboratories were producing enough vaccines and serum for hun-
dreds of thousands and perhaps millions of people, while from Boston a 
huge and much-publicized shipment of vaccine was rushed across the 
country to San Francisco. On October 3, Gorgas’s ofﬁce in Washington 
offered all headquarters personnel the antipneumococcal vaccine that 
Cole and Avery had such hopes for, the one vaccine that had been 
tested—and with such success—that spring at Camp Upton. 
Even in the midst of this death, this pressure, Avery would not be 
rushed. More and more reports came in that investigators around the 
world could not ﬁnd the inﬂuenza bacillus. This in itself proved nothing. 
It was almost a test of a bacteriologist’s skill to grow Pfeiffer’s in the lab-
oratory. At Camp Dodge in Iowa, for example, bacteriologists found 
Pfeiffer’s B. inﬂuenzae in only 9.6 percent of the autopsied cases. An ofﬁ-
cial army report blamed them: “The low incidence was undoubtedly due 
to poor technique in handling cultures. . . .  [B]acteriologic methods . . .  
of this camp . . . were  not to be depended upon.” The laboratory chief at 
Camp Grant, whom Welch himself had pronounced “excellent” just three 
months before the epidemic struck, found Pfeiffer’s bacillus in only six of 
198 autopsies. Even so, his own report said, “We are inclined to take the 
stand that this study does not prove the lack of association between the 
Pfeiffer’s bacillus and the epidemic owing to the irregular technique fol-
lowed.” 
Perhaps that was the case, perhaps technical errors prevented those at 
"
"The Race 
295 
Dodge and Grant and elsewhere from identifying the bacillus. Or per-
haps Pfeiffer’s was not present to be identiﬁed. 
In his usual methodical way Avery took the step most likely to settle 
the question. There was no drama to this step. He poured his energies 
into perfecting the tool, to ﬁnd ways to make it easier to grow B. inﬂuen-
zae. If he succeeded, then everyone could learn whether the inability to 
ﬁnd the bacillus was because of incompetence or the absence of the bac-
teria. 
He ﬁlled his laboratory with petri dishes, prepared the culture media 
in dozens of different ways, isolated the different factors, and observed in 
which dishes the bacteria seemed to grow best. Then he pushed each ele-
ment that seemed to encourage growth. A hypothesis lay behind each 
individual experiment. He had learned, for example, that the pneumo-
coccus inhibited the growth of Pfeiffer’s. So he wanted to prevent any 
pneumococci from growing. He already knew as much about the chem-
istry and metabolism of the pneumococcus as did any person living. He 
added a chemical, sodium oleate, to the medium to block pneumococcal 
growth. It worked. In cultures with sodium oleate the pneumococcus did 
not grow, and Pfeiffer’s grew better. 
Over a period of weeks he made signiﬁcant progress. Pfeiffer’s also 
required blood in the culture medium to grow, which was not so unusual. 
But blood serum inactivated the sodium oleate. So he centrifuged out 
only red blood cells and used them. And his experiments suggested that 
blood added to the culture at roughly body temperature inhibited 
growth. Avery found that heated blood, adding blood to media at nearly 
200 degrees Fahrenheit, allowed the B. inﬂuenzae to ﬂourish. 
He promptly published the recipe for his preparation, which became 
known as “chocolate agar,” in the Journal of the American Medical Associ-
ation, writing,“It is possible that technical difﬁculties in the isolation and 
growth of this microorganism may be in part responsible for the discor-
dant results obtained in different laboratories. . . .  The use of this 
medium has led to an increase in positive ﬁndings of B. inﬂuenzae in 
actual cases of the disease and in convalescents.” 
With this information any reasonably competent scientist could grow 
and identify the bacteria. At least now they would know that if Pfeiffer’s 
was not found it was because it was not there. 
"
"296 
The Great Influenza 
Avery himself still would not be rushed, would not discuss a conclu-
sion he was not yet ready to support. But based on Avery’s work Cole told 
Russell, “I feel less and less inclined to ascribe the primary infection to the 
inﬂuenza bacilli—although that possiblity cannot be excluded until the 
real cause of the infection is demonstrated. . . . I am very hopeful that 
the anti-pneumococcus vaccination can be pushed rapidly. While the 
anti-inﬂuenzal vaccination”—by this he meant vaccine against B. 
inﬂuenzae—“seems to me still doubtful we have very good evidence that 
the anti-pneumococcus vaccination is going to prove to be of a great 
help.” He added, “It seems to me the inﬂuenza epidemic gives an oppor-
tunity for developing this in a way that could not have otherwise been 
done.” 
There was nothing easy about making either the antipneumococcus 
serum, which in tests had just cured twenty-eight of twenty-nine patients 
suffering infection with Type I pneumococcus, or the vaccine. It took 
two months to prepare the vaccine properly, two months of a difﬁcult 
process: making 300-liter batches of broth—and the pneumococci them-
selves dissolved too often in ordinary broth, which meant adding chemi-
cals that later had to be removed—concentrating it, precipitating some of 
it out with alcohol, separating out the additives, standardizing it. Avery 
and other Rockefeller investigators did make one important advance in 
production: by adjusting the amount of glucose in the media they 
increased the yield tenfold. But they could still move only twenty-ﬁve 
liters a day through centrifuges. It mocked the need. 
In the meanwhile the killing continued.

hile science was confronting nature, society began to confront 
the effects of nature. For this went beyond the ability of any in-
dividual or group of individuals to respond to. To have any chance in 
alleviating the devastation of the epidemic required organization, co-
ordination, implementation. It required leadership and it required that 
institutions follow that leadership. 
Institutions are a strange mix of the mass and the individual. They 
abstract. They behave according to a set of rules that substitute both for 
individual judgments and for the emotional responses that occur when-
ever individuals interact. The act of creating an institution dehumanizes 
it, creates an arbitrary barrier between individuals. 
Yet institutions are human as well. They reﬂect the cumulative per-
sonalities of those within them, especially their leadership. They tend, 
unfortunately, to mirror less admirable human traits, developing and 
protecting self-interest and even ambition. Institutions almost never sac-
riﬁce. Since they live by rules, they lack spontaneity. They try to order 
chaos not in the way an artist or scientist does, through a deﬁning vision 
that creates structure and discipline, but by closing off and isolating 
themselves from that which does not ﬁt. They become bureaucratic. 
The best institutions avoid the worst aspects of bureaucracy in two 
ways. Some are not really institutions at all. They are simply a loose con-
federation of individuals, each of whom remains largely a free agent whose 
"
"300 
The Great Influenza 
achievements are independent of the institution but who also shares and 
beneﬁts from association with others. In these cases the institution sim-
ply provides an infrastructure that supports the individual, allowing him 
or her to ﬂourish so that the whole often exceeds the sum of the parts. 
(The Rockefeller Institute was such an institution.) Other institutions 
avoid the worst elements of bureaucracy by concentrating on a clearly 
deﬁned purpose. Their rules have little to do with such procedural issues 
as a chain of command; instead rules focus on how to achieve a particu-
lar result, in effect offering guidance based on experience. This kind of 
institution even at its best can still stultify creativity, but such institutions 
can execute, can do a routine thing efﬁciently. They resemble profession-
als trying to do their jobs and duty; they accomplish their tasks. 
In 1918 the institution of the federal government had more force than 
it had ever had—and in some ways more force than it has had since. But 
it was aiming all that force, all its vital energy, in another direction. 
The United States had entered the war with little preparation in April 
1917, and mobilizing the country took time. By the summer of 1918, 
however, Wilson had injected the government into every facet of national 
life and had created great bureaucratic engines to focus all the nation’s 
attention and intent on the war. 
He had created a Food Administration to control and distribute food, 
a Fuel Administration to ration coal and gasoline, a War Industries Board to 
oversee the entire economy. He had taken all but physical control over the 
railroads and had created a federally sponsored river barge line that brought 
commerce back to life on the Mississippi River, a commerce that had been 
killed by competition from those railroads. He had built many dozens of 
military installations, each of which held at least tens of thousands of sol-
diers or sailors. He had created industries that made America’s shipyards 
teem with hundreds of thousands of laborers launching hundreds of 
ships, dug new coal mines to produce coal for the factories that weaned 
America’s military from British and French weapons and munitions— 
for, unlike in World War II, America was no arsenal of democracy. 
He had created a vast propaganda machine, an internal spy network, 
a bond-selling apparatus extending to the level of residential city blocks. 
He had even succeeded in stiﬂing speech, in the summer of 1918 arrest-

but powerful men, even a congressman. 
He had injected the government into American life in ways unlike any 
other in the nation’s history. And the ﬁnal extension of federal power had 
come only in the spring of 1918, after the ﬁrst wave of inﬂuenza had 
begun jumping from camp to camp, when the government expanded 
the draft from males between the ages of twenty-one and thirty to 
those between the ages of eighteen and forty-ﬁve. Only on May 23, 1918, 
had Provost Marshal Enoch Crowder, who oversaw the draft, issued his 
“work or ﬁght” order, stating that anyone not employed in an essential 
industry would be drafted—an order that caused major league baseball 
to shorten its season and sent many ballplayers scurrying for jobs that 
were “essential”—and promising that “all men within the enlarged age 
would be called within a year.” All men, the government had said, with 
orders for an estimated thirteen million to register September 12. Crow-
der bragged about doing “in a day what the Prussian autocracy had been 
spending nearly ﬁfty years to perfect.” 
All this enormous and focused momentum would not be turned easily. 
It would not be turned even by the prospect of peace. In mid-August, as the 
lethal wave of the epidemic was gathering itself, Austria had already in-
quired about peace terms, an inquiry that Wilson rebuffed utterly. And as 
the epidemic was gathering full momentum, peace was only weeks away. 
Bulgaria had signed an armistice on September 29. On September 30, Kaiser 
Wilhelm had granted parliamentary government to the German nation; 
that same day Ludendorff had warned his government that Germany 
must extend peace feelers or disaster—immediate disaster—would fol-
low. German diplomats sent out those feelers. Wilson ignored them. The 
Central Powers, Germany and her allies, were simultaneously breaking 
off one from one another and disintegrating internally as well. In the ﬁrst 
week of October, Austria and Germany separately sent peace feelers to 
the Allies, and on October 7, Austria delivered a diplomatic note to Wil-
son formally seeking peace on any terms Wilson chose. Ten days later— 
days of battle and deaths—the Austrian note remained unanswered. 
Earlier Wilson had spoken of a “peace without victory,” believing only 
"
"302 
The Great Influenza 
such a peace could last. But now he gave no indication that the war would 
soon be over. Although a rumor that the war had ended sent thrills 
through the nation, Wilson quickly renounced it. Nor would he relent. 
He was not now ﬁghting to the death; he was ﬁghting only to kill. To ﬁght 
you must be brutal and ruthless, he had said. Force!  he had demanded. 
Force to the utmost! Force without stint or limit! The righteous and tri-
umphant Force which shall make Right the law of the world, and cast every 
selﬁsh dominion down in the dust. 
Reﬂecting his will, there was no letup in the ferocity and wrath of the 
Liberty Loan rallies, no letup in the frenzied pressure to produce in coal 
mines and shipyards, no letup among editorials or for that matter news 
stories exhorting people to insist upon total and complete German capit-
ulation. Especially within the government itself, there was no letup. In-
stead Wilson pressed, pressed with all his might—and that meant all the 
nation’s might—for total victory. 
If Wilson and his government would not be turned from his end even 
by the prospect of peace, they would hardly be turned by a virus. And the 
reluctance, inability, or outright refusal of the American government to 
shift targets would contribute to the killing. Wilson took no public note 
of the disease, and the thrust of the government was not diverted. The 
relief effort for inﬂuenza victims would ﬁnd no assistance in the Food 
Administration or the Fuel Administration or the Railroad Administra-
tion. From neither the White House nor any other senior administration 
post would there come any leadership, any attempt to set priorities, any 
attempt to coordinate activities, any attempt to deliver resources. 
The military, especially the army, would confront the virus directly. 
Gorgas had done all that he could have, all that anyone could have, to 
prepare for an emergency. But the military would give no help to civil-
ians. Instead it would draw further upon civilian resources. 
The same day that Welch had stepped out of the autopsy room at 
Devens and called Gorgas’s ofﬁce, his warning had been relayed to the army 
chief of staff, urging that all transfers be frozen unless absolutely neces-
sary and that under no circumstances transfers from infected camps be 
made: The deaths at Camp Devens will probably exceed 500. . . .  The expe-
rience at Camp Devens may be fairly expected to occur at other large can-
tonments. . . . New men will  almost surely contract the disease. 
Gorgas’s superiors ignored the warning. There was no interruption of 
"
"303 
The Tolling of the Bell 
movement between camps whatsoever; not until weeks later, with the 
camps paralyzed and, literally, tens of thousands of soldiers dead or 
dying, did the army make any adjustments. 
One man did act, however. On September 26, although many training 
camps had not yet seen any inﬂuenza cases at all, Provost Marshal Enoch 
Crowder canceled the next draft (he would also cancel the draft after this 
one). It had been scheduled to send one hundred forty-two thousand 
men to the cantonments. 
It was a bold move, made despite the unquenched appetite of George 
Pershing, in charge of the American Expeditionary Force, for men. In 
France, Pershing was pressing forward, earlier that same day launching a 
major offensive in the Meuse-Argonne region. As the Americans charged 
out of their trenches, the Germans shredded their ranks. General Max 
von Gallwitz, the commander facing them, entered into his ofﬁcial 
record, “We [have] no more worries.” 
Despite this, Crowder had acted immediately and likely saved thou-
sands of lives, but he did not cancel the draft to save lives. He did so 
because he recognized that the disease was utterly overwhelming and 
creating total chaos in the cantonments. There could be no training until 
the disease passed. He believed that sending more draftees into this chaos 
would only magnify it and delay the restoration of order and the produc-
tion of soldiers. In Murder in the Cathedral, T. S. Eliot could call it “the 
greatest treason: to do the right thing for the wrong reason.” The men 
who lived because of Crowder might disagree with the poet. 
But Crowder’s decision and the efforts of the Gorgas-led army med-
ical corps would be the only bright spots in the response of the federal 
government. Other army decisions were not such good ones. Pershing 
still demanded fresh troops, troops to replace those killed or wounded in 
battle, troops to replace those killed by or recovering from inﬂuenza, 
troops to replace those who simply needed relief from the line. All the 
Allied powers were desperate for fresh American boys. 
The army had to decide whether to continue to transport soldiers to 
France during the epidemic. They had information about the costs. The 
army knew the costs well. 
On September 19 the acting army surgeon general, Charles Richard— 
Gorgas was in Europe—wrote General Peyton March, the commander of 
"
"304 
The Great Influenza 
the army, urging him that “organizations known to be infected, or 
exposed to the disease, be not permitted to embark for overseas service 
until the disease has run its course within the organization.” 
March acknowledged the warning from Gorgas’s deputy but did 
nothing. The chief medical ofﬁcer at the port of embarkation in Newport 
News, Virginia, rephrased—more emphatically—the same warning: “The 
condition [on a troopship] is almost that of a powder magazine with 
troops unprotected by previous [inﬂuenza] attack. The spark will be 
applied sooner or later. On the other hand with troops protected by pre-
vious attack the powder has been removed.” He too was ignored. Gorgas’s 
ofﬁce urged quarantining troops heading overseas for one week before 
departure, or eliminating overcrowding on board. March did nothing. 
Meanwhile the Leviathan was loading troops. Once the pride of the 
German passenger ﬂeet, built as the Vaterland, she was the largest ship in 
the world and among the fastest in her class. She had been in New York 
when America entered the war, and her captain could not bring himself 
to sabotage or scuttle her. Alone among all German ships conﬁscated in 
the United States, she was taken undamaged. In mid-September, on her 
voyage back from France she had buried several crew and passengers at 
sea, dead of inﬂuenza. Others arrived in New York sick, including Assis-
tant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Roosevelt, who was taken ashore on a 
stretcher, then by ambulance to his mother’s home on East Sixty-ﬁfth 
Street, where he stayed for weeks too ill to speak with even his closest 
adviser, Louis Howe, who kept in almost hourly touch with his doctors. 
The Leviathan and, over the course of the next several weeks, other 
troopships would ferry approximately one hundred thousand troops to 
Europe. Their crossings became much like that of the train that carried 
three thousand one hundred soldiers from Camp Grant to Camp Han-
cock. They became death ships. 
Although the army had ignored most of the pleadings from its own 
medical corps, it did remove all men showing inﬂuenza symptoms before 
sailing. And to contain inﬂuenza on board, troops were quarantined. 
Military police carrying pistols enforced the quarantine—aboard the 
Leviathan, 432 MPs did so—sealing soldiers into separate areas of the 
ship behind shut watertight doors, sardining them into cramped quarters 
where they had little to do but lie on stacked bunks or shoot craps or play 
poker in the creases of open space available. Fear of submarines forced 
"
"305 
The Tolling of the Bell 
the portholes shut at night, but even during the day the closed doors and 
the massive overcrowding made it impossible for the ventilation system 
to keep pace. Access to the decks and open air was limited. The sweat 
and smells of hundreds of men—each room generally held up to four 
hundred—in close quarters quickly became a stench. Sound echoed off 
the steel bunks, the steel ﬂoors, the steel walls, the steel ceiling. Living 
almost like caged animals, they grew increasingly claustrophobic and 
tense. But at least they were safe, they thought. 
For the plan to keep men quarantined in isolated groups had a ﬂaw. 
They had to eat. They went to mess one group at a time, but they breathed 
the same air, their hands went from mouths to the same tables and doors 
that other soldiers had touched only minutes before. 
Despite the removal before departure of men showing inﬂuenza 
symptoms, within forty-eight hours after leaving port, soldiers and sailors 
struck down with inﬂuenza overwhelmed the sick bay, stacked one on 
top of the other in bunks, clogging every possible location, coughing, 
bleeding, delirious, displacing the healthy from one great room after 
another. Nurses themselves became sick. Then the horrors began. 
Colonel Gibson, commander of the Fifty-seventh Vermont, wrote of 
his regiment’s experience on the Leviathan: “The ship was packed . . . 
[C]onditions were such that the inﬂuenza could breed and multiply with 
extraordinary swiftness. . . .  The number of sick increased rapidly, Wash-
ington was apprised of the situation, but the call for men for the Allied 
armies was so great that we must go on at any cost. . . . Doctors and  
nurses were stricken. Every available doctor and nurse was utilized to the 
limit of endurance. The conditions during the night cannot be visualized 
by anyone who had not actually seen them . . .  [G]roans and cries of the 
terriﬁed added to the confusion of the applicants clamoring for treat-
ment and altogether a true inferno reigned supreme.” 
It was the same on other ships. Pools of blood from hemorrhaging 
patients lay on the ﬂoor and the healthy tracked the blood through the 
ship, making decks wet and slippery. Finally, with no room in sick bay, no 
room in the areas taken over for makeshift sick bays, corpsmen and 
nurses began laying men out on deck for days at a time. Robert Wallace 
aboard the Briton remembered lying on deck when a storm came, 
remembered the ship rolling, the ocean itself sweeping up the scuppers 
and over him and the others, drenching them, their clothes, their blan-
"

kets, leaving them coughing and sputtering. And each morning orderlies 
carried away bodies. 
At ﬁrst the deaths of men were separated by a few hours: the log of the 
Leviathan noted, “12:45 p.m. Thompson, Earl, Pvt 4252473, company 
unknown died on board. . . .  3:35 p.m. Pvt O Reeder died on board of 
lobar pneumonia. . . .”  But a week after leaving New York, the ofﬁcer of 
the day was no longer bothering to note in the log “died on board,” no 
longer bothering to identify the military organization to which the dead 
belonged, no longer bothering to note a cause of death; he was writing 
only a name and a time, two names at 2:00 a.m., another at 2:02 a.m., two 
more at 2:15 a.m., like that all through the night, every notation in the log 
now a simple recitation of mortality, into the morning a death at 7:56 
a.m., at 8:10 a.m., another at 8:10 a.m., at 8:25 a.m. 
The burials at sea began. They quickly became sanitary exercises more 
than burials, bodies lying next to one another on deck, a few words and a 
name spoken, then one at a time a corpse slipped overboard into the sea. 
One soldier aboard the Wilhelmina watched across the waves as bodies 
dropped into the sea from another ship in his convoy, the Grant: “I confess 
I was near to tears, and that there was tightening around my throat. It was 
death, death in one of its worst forms, to be consigned nameless to the sea.” 
The transports became ﬂoating caskets. Meanwhile, in France, by any 
standard except that of the cantonments at home, inﬂuenza was devas-
tating troops. In the last half of October during the Meuse-Argonne 
offensive, America’s largest of the war, more Third Division troops were 
evacuated from the front with inﬂuenza than with wounds. (Roughly the 
same number of troops were in the United States and Europe, but 
inﬂuenza deaths in Europe were only half those in America. The likely 
explanation is that soldiers at the front had been exposed to the earlier 
mild wave of inﬂuenza and developed some immunity to it.) One army 
surgeon wrote in his diary on October 17 that because of the epidemic, 
“Some hospitals are not even working. Evacuation 114 had no medical 
ofﬁcer but hundreds of pneumonias, . . . dying by the score.” 
Shipping more men who required medical care into this maelstrom 
made little sense. It is impossible to state how many soldiers the ocean 
voyages killed, especially when one tries to count those infected aboard 
ship who died later on shore. But for every death at least four or ﬁve men 
"

were ill enough to be incapacitated for weeks. These men were a burden 
rather than a help in Europe. 
Wilson had made no public statement about inﬂuenza. He would not 
shift his focus, not for an instant. Yet people he trusted spoke to him of 
the disease, spoke particularly of useless deaths on the transports. Chief 
among them was certainly Dr. Cary Grayson, a navy admiral and Wilson’s 
personal physician, as he had been personal physician to Teddy Roosevelt 
and William Howard Taft when they were president. Highly competent 
and highly organized, Grayson had become a Wilson conﬁdant who strayed 
into the role of adviser. (After Wilson’s stroke in 1919, he would be accused 
of virtually running the country in concert with Wilson’s wife.) He also 
had the conﬁdence of and excellent relationships with Gorgas and Welch. 
It was likely that army medical staff had talked to Grayson, and Grayson 
had been urging army chief of staff General Peyton March to freeze the 
movement of troops to Europe. March had refused. 
Grayson convinced Wilson to summon March to the White House on 
October 7 to discuss the issue. Late that night Wilson and March met. 
Wilson said, “General March, I have had representations sent to me by 
men whose ability and patriotism are unquestioned that I should stop 
the shipment of men to France until this epidemic of inﬂuenza is under 
control. . . .  [Y]ou decline to stop these shipments.” 
March made no mention of any of the advice he had received from 
Gorgas’s ofﬁce. He insisted that every possible precaution was being 
taken. The troops were screened before embarking and the sick win-
nowed out. Some ships even put ashore in Halifax, Nova Scotia, those 
who fell seriously ill before the actual Atlantic crossing began. If Ameri-
can divisions stopped arriving in France, whatever the reason, German 
morale might soar. True, some men had died aboard ship, but, March 
said, “Every such soldier who has died just as surely played his part as his 
comrade who died in France.” 
The war would end in a little over a month. The epidemic had made 
virtually all training in cantonments impossible. A parliament—not the 
kaiser—had already taken over the German government and sent out peace 
feelers, while Germany’s allies had already collapsed, capitulated, or, in the 
case of Austria, asked for peace on any terms Wilson dictated. But March 
insisted, “The shipment of troops should not be stopped for any cause.” 
March later wrote that Wilson turned in his chair, gazed out the win-
"

The Great Influenza 
dow, his face very sad, then gave a faint sigh. In the end, only a single mil-
itary activity would continue unaffected in the face of the epidemic. The 
army continued the voyages of troopships overseas. 
If Wilson did nothing about inﬂuenza in the military but express concern 
about shipping troops to Europe, he did even less for civilians. He con-
tinued to say nothing publicly. There is no indication that he ever said 
anything privately, that he so much as inquired of anyone in the civilian 
arm of the government as to its efforts to ﬁght the disease. 
Wilson had appointed strong men to his administration, powerful 
men, and they took decisive actions. They dominated the nation’s thought, 
and they dominated the nation’s economy. But none of those appointees 
had any real responsibility for health. Surgeon General Rupert Blue, 
head of the United States Public Health Service, did. And Blue was not a 
strong man. 
A square-faced man with a square thick athletic body, an amateur 
boxer, Blue was physically strong all right, even deep into middle age. 
But he was not strong in ways that mattered, in leadership. In a ﬁeld that 
was largely new when he entered it, a ﬁeld in which colleagues were cut-
ting new paths into the wild in dozens of directions, he had broken no 
ground, demonstrated no professional courage, nor had he even showed 
real zeal. If he was by no means unintelligent, he lacked either real intel-
lectual rigor or the creativity to ask important questions, and he had 
never manifested any truly special talents in or insights into public health. 
As far as scientiﬁc public health issues went, the real leaders of the 
medical profession considered him a lightweight. Welch and Vaughan 
had not even trusted him to name the Public Health Service’s representa-
tive to the National Research Council, and so they themselves had picked 
a PHS scientist they respected. Cary Grayson thought so little of him that 
he began to build an alternative national public health organization. (He 
abandoned his effort when Tammany took over the New York City 
Department of Health.) Blue became surgeon general simply by carrying 
out assigned tasks well, proving himself an adept and diplomatic maneu-
verer, and seizing his main chance. That was all. 
After ﬁnishing his medical studies in 1892, Blue had immediately joined 
the Public Health Service and remained there his entire professional life. His 
assignments had moved him from port to port, to Baltimore, Galveston, 
"
"309 
The Tolling of the Bell 
New Orleans, Portland, New York, Norfolk, where he worked in hospitals 
and quarantine stations and on sanitation issues. His opportunity came 
with an outbreak of bubonic plague in San Francisco in 1903. Another 
PHS ofﬁcer, a highly regarded scientist, had engaged in a running battle 
with local government and business leaders, who denied plague existed 
in the city. Blue did not prove that it did—Simon Flexner did that, 
demonstrating the plague bacillus in the laboratory, as part of a scientiﬁc 
team brought in to settle the question—but Blue did win grudging coop-
eration from local authorities in efforts to control the disease. This was 
no easy task, and he both oversaw the killing of rats and kept, according 
to one laudatory report, “all interests in the State . . . harmonized.” 
This success won him powerful friends. (He was not successful enough, 
however, to prevent plague spreading from rats to wild rodent popula-
tions; today plague exists in squirrels, prairie dogs, and other animals in 
much of the Paciﬁc Coast and inland to Arizona, New Mexico, and Col-
orado.) When plague resurfaced in San Francisco in 1907 he was called 
back. Another success won him more powerful friends. In 1912 he rose to 
surgeon general. That same year Congress expanded the Public Health 
Service’s power. From that position he pushed for national medical 
insurance, which the medical profession then advocated, and in 1916 he 
became president of the American Medical Association. In his presiden-
tial address he declared, “There are unmistakable signs that health insur-
ance will constitute the next great step in social legislation.” 
Wilson did not bother to choose a new surgeon general, but when the 
war began he did make the Public Health Service part of the military. It 
had consisted chieﬂy of several quarantine stations that inspected incom-
ing ships, the Marine Hospital Service, which cared for merchant seamen 
and some federal workers, and the Hygienic Laboratory. Now it became 
responsible for protecting the nation’s health, if only so the nation could 
produce more war matériel. Blue did not grow with the job. 
In advance of the epidemic, Gorgas had used all means possible to 
protect the millions of soldiers from disease. His counterpart Navy Sur-
geon General William Braisted had done little to match Gorgas, but he 
was supporting work by such men as Rosenau in Boston and Lewis in 
Philadelphia. 
Blue by contrast did, literally, less than nothing; he blocked relevant 
research. On July 28, 1918, Blue rejected a request from George McCoy, 
"
"310 
The Great Influenza 
director of the Hygienic Laboratory, for $10,000 for pneumonia research 
designed to complement the efforts of the Rockefeller Institute. Although 
Congress in 1912 had given the agency authority to study “diseases of 
man and conditions affecting the propagation thereof,” Blue determined 
that McCoy’s “investigation is not immediately necessary to the enforce-
ment of the law.” 
Blue knew of the possibility of inﬂuenza in the United States. On 
August 1, the Memphis Medical Monthly published comments by him 
warning of it. Yet he made no preparations whatsoever to try to contain 
it. Even after it began to show evidence of lethality, even after Rufus Cole 
prodded his ofﬁce to collect data, neither he nor his ofﬁce attempted to 
gather information about the disease anywhere in the world. And he made 
no effort whatsoever to prepare the Public Health Service for a crisis. 
Many of those under him were no better. The Commonwealth Pier 
outbreak began late in August, and by September 9 newspapers were 
reporting that inﬂuenza victims ﬁlled “all the hospital beds at the forts at 
Boston harbor,” Camp Devens had thirty-ﬁve hundred inﬂuenza cases, 
and Massachusetts hospitals were ﬁlling with civilians. Yet the local Pub-
lic Health Service ofﬁcer later insisted, “The ﬁrst knowledge of the exis-
tence of the disease reached this ofﬁcer September 10th.” 
The virus had reached New Orleans on September 4; the Great Lakes 
Naval Training Station on September 7; New London, Connecticut, on 
September 12. 
Not until September 13 did the Public Health Service make any pub-
lic comment, when it said, “Owing to disordered conditions in European 
countries, the bureau has no authoritative information as to the nature of 
the disease or its prevalence.” That same day Blue did issue a circular 
telling all quarantine stations to inspect arriving ships for inﬂuenza. But 
even that order only advised delaying infected vessels until “the local 
health authorities have been notiﬁed.” 
Later Blue defended himself for not taking more aggressive action. 
This was inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza, he seemed to be saying, “It would be 
manifestly unwarranted to enforce strict quarantine against . . . inﬂuenza.” 
No quarantine of shipping could have succeeded anyway. The virus 
was already here. But Blue’s circular indicated how little Blue had done— 
in fact he had done nothing—to prepare the Public Health Service, much 
less the country, for any onslaught. 
"
"311 
The Tolling of the Bell 
The virus reached Puget Sound on September 17. 
Not until September 18 did Blue even seek to learn which regions of 
the United States the disease had penetrated. 
On Saturday, September 21, the ﬁrst inﬂuenza death occurred in 
Washington, D.C. The dead man was John Ciore, a railroad brakeman 
who had been exposed to the disease in New York four days earlier. That 
same day Camp Lee outside Petersburg, Virginia, had six deaths, while 
Camp Dix in New Jersey saw thirteen soldiers and one nurse die. 
Still Blue did little. On Sunday, September 22, the Washington news-
papers reported that Camp Humphreys (now Fort Belvoir), just outside 
the city, had sixty-ﬁve cases. 
Now, ﬁnally, in a box immediately adjacent to those reports, the local 
papers ﬁnally published the government’s ﬁrst warning of the disease: 
Surgeon General’s Advice to Avoid Inﬂuenza 
Avoid needless crowding. . . .  
Smother your coughs and sneezes. . . .  
Your nose not your mouth was made to breathe thru. . . .  
Remember the 3 Cs, clean mouth, clean skin, and clean clothes. . . .  
Food will win the war. . . .  [H]elp by choosing and chewing your food 
well. . . .  
Wash your hands before eating. . . .  
Don’t let the waste products of digestion accumulate. . . .  
Avoid tight clothes, tight shoes, tight gloves—seek to make nature your 
ally not your prisoner. . . .  
When the air is pure breathe all of it you can—breathe deeply. 
Such generalizations hardly reassured a public that knew that the dis-
ease was marching from army camp to army camp, killing soldiers in 
large numbers. Three days later a second inﬂuenza death occurred in 
Washington; John Janes, like the ﬁrst Washington victim, had contracted 
the disease in New York City. Also that day senior medical personnel of 
the army, navy, and Red Cross met in Washington to try to ﬁgure out how 
they could aid individual states. Neither Blue nor a representative of the 
Public Health Service attended the meeting. Twenty-six states were then 
reporting inﬂuenza cases. 
Blue had still not laid plans for an organization to ﬁght the disease. He 
"
"312 
The Great Influenza 
had taken only two actions: publishing his advice on how to avoid the 
disease and asking the National Academy of Sciences to identify the 
pathogen, writing, “In view of the importance which outbreaks of 
inﬂuenza will have on war production, the Bureau desires to leave noth-
ing  undone. . . .  The Bureau would deem it a valuable service if the 
Research Council arrange for suitable laboratory studies . . . as to the  
nature of the infecting organism.” 
Crowder canceled the draft. Blue still did not organize a response to 
the emergency. Instead, the senior Public Health Service ofﬁcer in charge 
of the city of Washington reiterated to the press that there was no cause 
for alarm. 
Perhaps Blue considered any further action outside the authority of 
the Public Health Service. Under him the service was a thoroughly bureau-
cratic institution, and bureaucratic in none of the good ways. Only a 
decade earlier he had been stationed in New Orleans, when the last yellow-
fever epidemic to strike the United States had hit there, and the Public 
Health Service had required the city to pay $250,000—in advance—to 
cover the federal government’s expenses in helping to ﬁght that epidemic. 
Only a few weeks earlier, he had rejected the request from the service’s 
own chief scientist for money to research pneumonia in concert with 
Cole and Avery at the Rockefeller Institute. 
But governors and mayors were demanding help, beseeching 
everyone in Washington for help. Massachusetts ofﬁcials in particular 
were begging for help from outside the state, for doctors from outside, for 
nurses from outside, for laboratory assistance from outside. The death 
toll there had climbed into the thousands. Governor Samuel McCall had 
wired governors for any assistance they could offer, and on September 26 
he formally requested help from the federal government. 
Doctors and nurses were what was needed. Doctors and nurses. And 
especially nurses. As the disease spread, as warnings from Welch, Vaughan, 
Gorgas, dozens of private physicians, and, ﬁnally, at last, Blue poured in, 
Congress acted. Without the delay of hearings or debate, it appropriated 
$1 million for the Public Health Service. The money was enough for Blue 
to hire ﬁve thousand doctors for emergency duty for a month—if he 
could somehow ﬁnd ﬁve thousand doctors worth hiring. 
Each day—indeed, each hour—was showing the increasingly explo-
sive spread of the virus and its lethality. Blue, as if suddenly frightened, 
"
"313 
The Tolling of the Bell 
now considered the money too little. He had not complained to Congress 
about the amount; no record exists of his having asked for more. But the 
same day Congress passed the appropriation, he privately appealed to the 
War Council of the Red Cross both for more money and for its help. 
The Red Cross did not get government funds or direction, although it 
was working in close concert with the government. Nor was its charge to 
care for the public health. Yet even before Blue asked, it had already allo-
cated money to ﬁght the epidemic and had begun organizing its own 
effort to do so—and do so on a massive scale. Its nursing department had 
already begun mobilizing “Home Defense Nurses,” fully professional 
nurses, all of them women, who could not serve in the military because 
of age, disability, or marriage. The Red Cross had divided the country 
into thirteen divisions, and the nursing committee chief of each one had 
already been told to ﬁnd all people with any nursing training, not only 
professionals or those who had dropped out of nursing schools—for the 
Red Cross checked with all nursing schools—but down to and including 
anyone who had ever taken a Red Cross course in caring for the sick at 
home. It had already instructed each division to form at least one mobile 
strike force of nurses to be ready to go to areas most in need. And before 
anyone within the government sought aid, the War Council of the Red 
Cross had designated a “contingent fund for the purpose of meeting the 
present needs in coping with the epidemic of Spanish inﬂuenza.” Now 
the council agreed instantly to authorize expenditure of far more money 
than was in the contingency fund. 
Finally, Blue began to organize the Public Health Service as well. Doc-
tors and nurses were what was needed, doctors and nurses. But by then 
the virus had spanned the country, establishing itself on the perimeter, 
on the coasts, and it was working its way into the interior, to Denver, 
Omaha, Minneapolis, Boise. It was penetrating Alaska. It had crossed the 
Paciﬁc to Hawaii. It had surfaced in Puerto Rico. It was about to explode 
across Western Europe, across India, across China, across Africa as well. 
Science, then as now a journal written by scientists for their colleagues, 
warned, “The epidemics now occurring appear with electric suddenness, 
and, acting like powerful, uncontrolled currents, produce violent and 
eccentric effects. The disease never spreads slowly and insidiously. Wher-
ever it occurs its presence is startling.” 
October, not April, would be the cruelest month.

othing could have stopped the sweep of inﬂuenza through 
either the United States or the rest of the world—but ruthless inter-
vention and quarantines might have interrupted its progress and created 
occasional ﬁrebreaks. 
Action as ruthless as that taken in 2003 to contain the outbreak 
of a new disease called severe acute respiratory disorder, SARS, could 
well have had effect.* Inﬂuenza could not have been contained as SARS 
was—inﬂuenza is far more contagious. But any interruption in inﬂuenza’s 
spread could have had signiﬁcant impact. For the virus was growing 
weaker over time. Simply delaying its arrival in a community or slowing 
its spread once there—just such minor successes—would have saved 
many, many thousands of lives. 
There was precedent for ruthless action. Only two years earlier several 
East Coast cities had fought a polio outbreak with the most stringent 
measures. Public health authorities wherever polio threatened had been 
relentless. But that was before the United States entered the war. There 
would be no comparable effort for inﬂuenza. Blue would not even attempt 
to intrude upon war work. 
The Public Health Service and the Red Cross still had a single chance 
to accomplish something of consequence. By early October the ﬁrst fall

outbreaks and the memory of those in the spring had already suggested 
that the virus attacked in a cycle; it took roughly six weeks from the 
appearance of the ﬁrst cases for the epidemic to peak and then abate in 
civilian areas, and from three to four weeks in a military camp with its 
highly concentrated population. After the epidemic abated, cases still 
occurred intermittently, but not in the huge numbers that overwhelmed 
all services. So Red Cross and Public Health Service planners expected the 
attack would be staggered just as the arrival of the virus was staggered, 
peaking in different parts of the country at different times. During the 
peak of the epidemic, individual communities would not be able to cope; 
no matter how well organized they were they would be utterly over-
whelmed. But if the Red Cross and Public Health Service could concen-
trate doctors, nurses, and supplies in one community when most needed, 
they might be able to withdraw the aid as the disease ebbed and shift it to 
the next area in need, and the next. 
To manage this, Blue and Frank Persons, director of civilian relief and 
head of the new inﬂuenza committee of the Red Cross, divided the labor. 
The Public Health Service would ﬁnd, pay, and assign all physicians. It 
would decide when and where to send nurses and supplies, to whom 
nurses would report, and it would deal with state and local public health 
authorities. 
The Red Cross would ﬁnd and pay nurses, furnish emergency hospi-
tals with medical supplies wherever local authorities could not, and take 
responsibility for virtually everything else that came up, including dis-
tributing information. The Red Cross did stipulate one limit on its 
responsibility: it would not meet requests from military camps. This stip-
ulation was immediately forgotten; even the Red Cross soon gave the mil-
itary precedence over civilians. Meanwhile, its War Council ordered each 
one of its 3,864 chapters to establish an inﬂuenza committee even— 
indeed, especially—where the disease had not yet hit. It gave instructions 
on the organization of those committees, and it stated “each community 
should depend upon its own resources to the fullest extent.” 
Persons had one model: Massachusetts. There James Jackson, the Red 
Cross division director for New England, had done an amazing job, espe-
cially considering that the region was struck without warning by what was 
originally an unknown disease. While chapters made gauze masks—the 
masks that would soon be seen everywhere and would become a symbol

of the epidemic—Jackson ﬁrst tried to supply nurses and doctors him-
self. When he failed, he formed an ad hoc umbrella organization includ-
ing the state Council of National Defense, the U.S. Public Health Service, 
state and local public health authorities, and the Red Cross. These groups 
pooled their resources and allocated to towns as needed. 
Jackson had brought in nurses from Providence, New Haven, New 
York, even from Halifax and Toronto. He had succeeded at least some-
what in alleviating the personnel shortage. But Massachusetts had been 
lucky. When the epidemic erupted there, no other locality needed help. In 
the fourth week of the epidemic, Jackson reported, “We have not yet 
reached the point where any community has been able to transfer its 
nurses or supplies. In Camp Devens . . . forty nurses ill there with many 
cases of pneumonia.” 
He also advised Red Cross headquarters in Washington: “The most 
important thing in this crisis is more workers to go into the homes 
quickly and aid the family. Consequently I have telegraphed to all my 
chapters twice regarding the mobilization of women who have had First 
Aid and Home Nursing training or any others who are willing to volun-
teer their services.” 
And he conﬁded, “The Federal public health service has been . . .  
unable to handle adequately the entire situation. . . .  [They] have not 
been on the job.” 
It was October when he sent that wire. By then everyone needed nurses, 
or they were about to, and they knew it. By then everyone needed doc-
tors, or they were about to, and they knew it. And they needed resources. 
The biggest task remained ﬁnding doctors, nurses, and resources. They 
needed all three. 
Even in the face of this pandemic, doctors could help. They could save 
lives. If they were good enough, if they had the right resources, if they had 
the right help, if they had time. 
True, no drug or therapy could alleviate the viral infection. Anyone 
who died directly from a violent infection of the inﬂuenza virus itself, 
from viral pneumonia progressing to ARDS, would have died anyway. In 
1918, ARDS had virtually a 100 percent mortality rate. 
But there were other causes of death. By far the most common was 
from pneumonia caused by secondary bacterial infections. 
"
"317 
The Tolling of the Bell 
Ten days, two weeks, sometimes even longer than two weeks after the 
initial attack by the virus, after victims had felt better, after recovery had 
seemed to begin, victims were suddenly getting seriously ill again. And 
they were dying. The virus was stripping their lungs all but naked of their 
immune system; recent research suggests that the virus made it easier for 
some kinds of bacteria to lodge in lung tissue as well. Bacteria were tak-
ing advantage, invading the lungs, and killing. People were learning, and 
doctors were advising, and newspapers were warning, that even when a 
patient seemed to recover, seemed to feel ﬁne, normal, well enough to go 
back to work, still that patient should continue to rest, continue to stay in 
bed. Or else that patient was risking his or her life. 
Half a dozen years earlier medicine had been helpless here, so helpless 
that Osler in his most recent edition of his classic text on the practice of 
medicine had still called for bleeding of patients with pneumonia. But 
now, for some of those who developed a secondary bacterial infection, 
something could be done. The most advanced medical practice, the best 
doctors, could help—if they had the resources and the time. 
Avery, Cole, and others at the Rockefeller Institute had developed the 
vaccine that had showed such promising result in the test at Camp Upton 
in the spring, and the Army Medical School was producing this vaccine 
in mass quantities. Avery and Cole had also developed the serum that 
slashed the mortality for pneumonias caused by Types I and II pneumo-
coccus, which accounted for two-thirds or more of lobar pneumonias in 
normal circumstances. These were not normal circumstances; bacteria 
that almost never caused pneumonia were now making their way unop-
posed into the lungs, growing there, and thriving there. But Types I and 
II pneumococci were still causing many of the pneumonias, and in those 
cases this serum could help. 
Other investigators had developed other vaccines and sera as well. 
Some, like the one developed by E. C. Rosenow at the Mayo Clinic and 
used in Chicago, were useless. But others may have done some good. 
Physicians also had other assets to call upon. Surgeons developed new 
techniques during the epidemic that are still in use to drain empyemas, 
pockets of pus and infection that formed in the lung and poisoned the 
body. And doctors had drugs that alleviated some symptoms or stimu-
lated the heart; major hospitals had x rays that could aid in diagnosis and 
triage; and some hospitals had begun administering oxygen to help vic-

tims breathe—a practice neither widespread nor administered nearly as 
effectively as it would be, but worth something. 
Yet for a doctor to use these resources, any of them, that doctor had to 
have them—and also had to have time. The physical resources were hard 
to come by, but time was harder. There was no time. For that Rockefeller 
serum needed to be administered with precision and in numerous doses. 
There was no time. Not with patients overﬂowing wards, ﬁlling cots in 
hallways and on porches, not with doctors themselves falling ill and ﬁll-
ing those cots. Even if they had resources, they had no time. 
And the doctors found by the Public Health Service had neither 
resources nor time. Nor was it simple to ﬁnd the doctors themselves. The 
military had already taken at least one-fourth—in some areas one-
third—of all the physicians and nurses. And the army, itself under violent 
attack from the virus, would lend none of its doctors to civilian commu-
nities no matter how desperate the circumstances. 
That left approximately one hundred thousand doctors in a labor 
pool to draw from—but it was a pool limited in quality. The Council of 
National Defense had had local medical committees secretly grade col-
leagues; those committees had judged roughly seventy thousand unﬁt for 
military service. Most of that number were unﬁt because they were 
judged incompetent. 
The government had had a plan to identify the best of those remain-
ing. As part of the mobilization of the entire nation, in January 1918 the 
Council of National Defense had created the “Volunteer Medical Ser-
vice.” This service tried to enlist every doctor in the United States, but it 
particularly wanted to track the younger physicians who were women or 
had a physical disability—in other words, those mostly likely to be good 
doctors who were not subject to and rejected by the draft. 
The mass targeting succeeded. Within eight months, 72,219 physi-
cians had joined this service. They had joined, however, only to prove 
their patriotism, not as a commitment to do anything real—for mem-
bership required of them nothing concrete, and they received an attrac-
tive piece of paper suitable for framing and ofﬁce display. 
But the plan to identify and have access to good doctors within this 
group collapsed. The virus was penetrating everywhere, doctors were 
needed everywhere, and no responsible doctor would abandon his (or, in 
a few instances, her) own patients in need, in desperate need. In addition, 
"
"319 
The Tolling of the Bell 
the federal government was paying only $50 a week—no princely sum 
even in 1918. Out of one hundred thousand civilian doctors, seventy-two 
thousand of whom had joined the Volunteer Medical Service, only 1,045 
physicians answered the pleas of the Public Health Service. While a few 
were good young doctors who had not yet developed a practice and were 
waiting to be drafted, many of this group were the least competent or 
poorest trained doctors in the country. Indeed, so few doctors worked for 
the PHS that Blue would later return $115,000 to the Treasury from the 
the $1 million appropriation he had considered so insufﬁcient. 
The Public Health Service sent these 1,045 doctors to places where 
there were no doctors at all, to places so completely devastated by the dis-
ease that any help, any help at all, was embraced. But they sent them with 
almost no resources, certainly without Rockefeller vaccines and serum or 
the training to make or administer them, certainly without x rays, cer-
tainly without oxygen and the means to administer it. The huge caseloads 
overwhelmed them, weighed them down, kept them moving. 
They diagnosed. They treated with all manner of materia medica. Yet 
in reality they could do nothing but advise. The best advice was this: stay 
in bed. And then the doctors moved on to the next cot or the next village. 
What could help, more than doctors, were nurses. Nursing could ease 
the strains on a patient, keep a patient hydrated, resting, calm, provide 
the best nutrition, cool the intense fevers. Nursing could give a victim of 
the disease the best possible chance to survive. Nursing could save lives. 
But nurses were harder to ﬁnd than doctors. There were one-quarter 
fewer to begin with. The earlier refusal of the women who controlled the 
nursing profession to allow the training of large numbers either of nurs-
ing aides or of what came to be called practical nurses prevented the cre-
ation of what might have been a large reserve force. The plan had been to 
produce thousands of such aides; instead the Army School of Nursing 
had been established. So far it had produced only 221 student nurses and 
not a single graduate nurse. 
Then, just before the epidemic struck, combat had intensiﬁed in 
France and with it so had the army’s need for nurses. The need had in fact 
become so desperate that on August 1, Gorgas, just to meet existing 
requirements, transferred one thousand nurses from cantonments in the 
United States to hospitals in France and simultaneously issued a call for 
“one thousand nurses a week” for eight weeks. 
"
"320 
The Great Influenza 
The Red Cross was the route of supply for nurses to the military, espe-
cially the army. It had already been recruiting nurses for the military with 
vigor. After Gorgas’s call, it launched an even more impassioned recruit-
ing campaign. Each division, each chapter within a division, was given a 
quota. Red Cross professionals knew that their careers were at risk if they 
did not meet it. Already recruiters had a list of all nurses in the country, 
their jobs and locations. Those recruiters now pressured nurses to quit 
jobs and join the military, pressured doctors to let ofﬁce nurses go, made 
wealthy patients who retained private nurses feel unpatriotic, pushed pri-
vate hospitals to release nurses. 
The drive was succeeding; it was removing from civilian life a huge 
proportion of those nurses mobile enough, unencumbered by family or 
other responsibilities, to leave their jobs. The drive was succeeding so well 
that it all but stripped hospitals of their workforce, leaving many private 
hospitals around the country so short-staffed that they closed, and re-
mained closed until the war ended. One Red Cross recruiter wrote, “The 
work at National Headquarters has never been so difﬁcult and is now 
overwhelming us. . . . [We are  searching] from one end of the United States 
to the other to rout out every possible nurse from her hiding place. . . .  
There will be no nurses left in civil life if we keep on at this rate.” 
The recruiter wrote that on September 5, three days before the virus 
exploded at Camp Devens.

hiladelphia staggered under the inﬂuenza attack, isolated and 
alone. In Philadelphia no sign surfaced of any national Red Cross 
and Public Health Service effort to help. No doctors recruited by the Pub-
lic Health Service were sent there. No nurses recruited by the Red Cross 
were sent there. Those institutions gave no help here. 
Each day people discovered that friends and neighbors who had been 
perfectly healthy a week—or a day—earlier were dead. What should I do? 
People were panicked, desperate. How long will it go on? 
The mayor, arrested in the early days of the epidemic and then him-
self ill, had done absolutely nothing. A review of ﬁve daily newspapers, 
the Press, Inquirer, Bulletin, Public Ledger, and North American, did not 
ﬁnd even a single statement about the crisis from the mayor. The entire 
city government had done nothing. Wilmer Krusen, head of the city 
health department, no longer had the conﬁdence of anyone. Someone 
had to do something. 
Paul Lewis felt the pressures, felt the death all about him. He had felt 
at least some pressure since the sailors from the City of Exeter had been 
dying what seemed so long ago. In early September, with the virus killing 
5 percent of all Philadelphia navy personnel who showed any symptoms 
of inﬂuenza at all, that pressure had intensiﬁed. Since then he and 
everyone under him had hardly left their laboratories to go home. Find-
ing B. inﬂuenzae had begun his real work, not concluded it. 
"
"322 
The Great Influenza 
Never had he been so consumed with the laboratory. He had started 
his experiments with the pneumococcus. He had begun to explore the 
possibility that a ﬁlterable virus caused inﬂuenza. He had continued to 
look at the inﬂuenza bacillus. He and others had developed a vaccine. He 
was trying to make a serum. All of these he did simultaneously. For the 
one thing he did not have was time. No one had time. 
If Lewis had a scientiﬁc weakness, it was that he too willingly accepted 
guidance from those he respected. Once when he asked for more direc-
tion from Flexner, Flexner had rebuffed him, saying, “I much prefer that 
you arrange plans. . . . I have  not planned speciﬁcally for your time, but 
much prefer to leave the direction of it to you.” Lewis respected Flexner. 
He respected Richard Pfeiffer as well. 
In the overwhelming majority of cases he was now ﬁnding Pfeiffer’s 
B. inﬂuenzae in swabs from living patients, in autopsied lungs. He was 
not ﬁnding it alone, necessarily, or always. It was not certain proof, but 
more and more he was coming to believe that this bacterium did in fact 
cause disease. And, under the pressure of time, he abandoned his investi-
gation into the possibility that a ﬁlterable virus caused inﬂuenza. 
Yet he loved this. Although he hated the disease he loved this. He 
believed he had been born to do this. He loved working deep into the 
night amid rows of glassware, monitoring the growth of bacteria in a 
hundred ﬂasks and petri dishes, running a dozen experiments in stag-
gered fashion; coordinating them like the conductor of a symphony. He 
even loved the unexpected result that could throw everything off. 
The only thing Lewis disliked about his position as head of an insti-
tute was charming the ﬁne families of Philadelphia out of philanthropic 
donations, attending their parties and performing as their pet scientist. 
The laboratory was where he had always belonged. Now he was in it 
hours and hours each day. He believed he had spent too much time mix-
ing with the ﬁne families of Philadelphia. 
In fact, those ﬁne families of the city deserved more respect. They 
were about to take charge. 
The writer Christopher Morley once said that Philadelphia lies “at the 
conﬂuence of the Biddle and Drexel families.” In 1918 that description 
was not far wrong. 
Of all the major cities in the United States, Philadelphia had a real 
"

claim to being the most “American.” It certainly had the largest percentage 
of native-born Americans of major cities and, compared to New York, 
Chicago, Boston, Detroit, Buffalo, and similar cities, the lowest percentage 
of immigrants. Philadelphia was not unusual in that its oldest and wealth-
iest families controlled the charities, the social service organizations— 
including the local Red Cross—and the Pennsylvania Council of National 
Defense. But now, with the city government all but nonexistent, it was 
unusual in that these families considered it their duty to use the Council 
of National Defense to take charge. 
Nationally that organization had been the vehicle through which, before 
the war, Wilson had laid plans to control the economy, using it to assem-
ble data from across the country on factories, transportation, labor, and 
natural resources. But each state had its own council, which were often 
dominated by his political enemies. Once the war started, Wilson created 
new federal institutions, sidestepped this organization, and it lost power. 
The Pennsylvania council, however, retained extraordinary, although al-
most entirely unofﬁcial, inﬂuence over everything from railroad schedules 
to proﬁts and wages at every large company in the state even though it too 
was run by Wilson’s enemies. It held this power chieﬂy because it was headed 
by George Wharton Pepper. 
No one had better bloodlines. His great-great-grandfather had led the 
state militia in the Revolutionary War, his wife was a descendant of Ben-
jamin Franklin, and a statue of his uncle William, who had worked 
closely with Welch to reform medical education and brought Flexner to 
the University of Pennsylvania, today sits astride the grand stairway of 
the Free Library in downtown Philadelphia. George Wharton Pepper had 
ability as well. An attorney who sat on the boards of half a dozen of the 
country’s largest companies, he was not ruthless, but he knew how to 
command. An indication of his stature had come a few months earlier 
when he received one of three honorary degrees awarded by Trinity Col-
lege in Hartford, Connecticut; his fellow honorees were J. P. Morgan and 
former president of the United States and soon-to-be chief justice of the 
Supreme Court William Howard Taft. 
The Philadelphia ofﬁce of the state Council of National Defense was 
run by Judge J. Willis Martin. His wife, Elizabeth, had organized the coun-
try’s ﬁrst garden club and was largely responsible for making Rittenhouse 
Square a green spot in the city. She also headed the council’s Women’s 
"
"324 
The Great Influenza 
Division as well as Emergency Aid, the most important private social 
agency in the city. 
Nearly all the social agencies were run by women, strong women of 
intelligence and energy and born to a certain rank, but excluded from all 
pursuits beside charity. The mayor had created a committee of society 
women to respond to emergencies; it included Pepper’s wife along with 
Mrs. John Wanamaker; Mrs. Edward Stotesbury, whose husband was the 
city’s leading banker and head of Drexel & Co.; and Mrs. Edward Biddle, 
president of the Civic Club and whose husband was descended from 
Nicholas Biddle, creator of the ﬁrst Bank of the United States, which to 
his nemesis Andrew Jackson embodied the sinister monied power of the 
nation. These women despised the Vare machine and had cooperated 
only to show unity during the war. But with city ofﬁcials doing nothing 
whatsoever about the epidemic, the women resigned, effectively dissolving 
the committee. As Elizabeth Martin wrote the mayor, “Your committee 
has no real purpose. . . . I therefore hereby sever my connection with it.” 
Now, in place of the city government, Pepper, the Martins, and their 
colleagues summoned the heads of a dozen private organizations on 
October 7 to the headquarters of Emergency Aid at 1428 Walnut Street. 
There the women took charge, with Pepper adding his weight to theirs. 
To sell war bonds, they had already organized nearly the entire city, all the 
way down to the level of each block, making each residential block the 
responsibility of “a logical leader no matter what her nationality”—i.e., 
an Irishwoman in an Irish neighborhood, an African American woman 
in an African American neighborhood, and so on. 
They intended to use that same organization now to distribute every-
thing from medical care to food. They intended to inject organization 
and leadership into chaos and panic. In conjunction with the Red Cross— 
which here, unlike nearly everywhere else in the country, allowed its own 
efforts to be incorporated into this larger Emergency Aid—they also 
appealed for nurses, declaring, “The death toll for one day in Philadelphia 
alone was greater than the death toll from France for the whole American 
Army for one day.” 
The state Council of National Defense had already compiled a list of 
every physician in Pennsylvania, including those not practicing. Martin’s 
ad hoc committee beseeched each one on the list for help. The commit-
tee had money, and access to more money, to pay for the help. It set up a 
"
"325 
The Tolling of the Bell 
twenty-four-hour telephone bank at Strawbridge & Clothier, which 
donated use of its phone lines; newspapers and placards urged people to 
call “Filbert 100” twenty-four hours a day for information and referrals. 
It transformed kitchens in public schools—which were closed—into 
soup kitchens that prepared meals for tens of thousands of people too ill 
to prepare their own. It divided the city into seven districts and, to con-
serve physicians’ time, dispatched them according to geography, meaning 
that doctors did not see their own patients. 
And it became a place that volunteers could come to. Nearly ﬁve 
hundred people offered to use their own cars either as ambulances or to 
chauffeur doctors—they were supplied with green ﬂags that gave them 
right-of-way over all other vehicles. The organizers of the Liberty Loan 
drive diverted another four hundred cars to help. Thousands of individ-
uals called the headquarters and offered to do what was needed. 
Krusen had not attended the October 7 meeting of the private groups 
and had been slow to act before. Now he changed. Perhaps the deaths 
ﬁnally changed him. Perhaps the fact that someone else was taking charge 
forced him to move. But he seemed suddenly not to care about the Vares, 
or selling war bonds, or bureaucracy, or his own power. He just wanted to 
stop the disease. 
He ceded to the group control over all nurses, hundreds of them, who 
worked for the city. He seized—in violation of the city charter—the city’s 
$100,000 emergency fund and another $25,000 from a war emergency 
fund and used the money to supply emergency hospitals and hire physi-
cians, paying them double what the Public Health Service was offering. 
He sent those physicians to every police station in South Philadelphia, 
the hardest-hit section. He wired the army and navy asking that no 
Philadelphia physicians be drafted until the epidemic abated, and that 
those who had already been drafted but had not yet reported to duty be 
allowed to remain in Philadelphia, because “the death rate for the past 
week [was] the largest in records of city.” 
The U.S. Public Health Service still had no presence in Philadelphia 
and had done nothing for it. Now Rupert Blue did the only thing he 
would do for the city in its distress: he wired the surgeon general of the 
navy to “heartily endorse” Krusen’s request. The deaths spoke far more 
loudly than Blue. The military did allow Philadelphia to keep its doctors. 
"
"326 
The Great Influenza 
Krusen also cleaned the streets. The streets of South Philadelphia liter-
ally stank of rot and excrement. Victorians had considered it axiomatic 
that ﬁlthy streets per se were linked to disease. The most modern public 
health experts—Charles Chapin in Providence, Biggs in New York, and 
others—ﬂatly rejected that idea. But Dr. Howard Anders, who earlier had 
been ignored by the press when he warned that the Liberty Loan parade 
would spread inﬂuenza, was given page one by the Ledger on October 10 to 
state, “Dirty streets, ﬁlth allowed to collect and stand until, germ-laden and 
disease-breeding, it is carried broadcast with the ﬁrst gust of wind—there 
you have one of the greatest causes of the terrible epidemic.” Other Philadel-
phia doctors agreed: “The condition of the streets spreads the epidemic.” 
So Krusen sent trucks and men down them with their water sprays 
and sweepers almost daily, doing the job Vare had been paid for many 
times but had never done. Krusen, Emergency Aid, and the Catholic 
Church teamed up to do one more thing, the most important thing. They 
began to clear the bodies. 
The corpses had backed up at undertakers’, ﬁlling every area of these 
establishments and pressing up into living quarters; in hospital morgues 
overﬂowing into corridors; in the city morgue overﬂowing into the 
street. And they had backed up in homes. They lay on porches, in closets, 
in corners of the ﬂoor, on beds. Children would sneak away from adults 
to stare at them, to touch them; a wife would lie next to a dead husband, 
unwilling to move him or leave him. The corpses, reminders of death and 
bringers of terror or grief, lay under ice at Indian-summer temperatures. 
Their presence was constant, a horror demoralizing the city; a horror that 
could not be escaped. Finally the city tried to catch up to them. 
Krusen sent police to clear homes of bodies that had remained there 
for more than a day, piling them in patrol wagons, but they could not 
keep up with the dying and fell further behind. The police wore their 
ghostly surgical masks, and people ﬂed them, but the masks had no effect 
on the viruses and by mid-October thirty-three policemen had died, with 
many more to follow. Krusen opened a “supplementary morgue” at a 
cold-storage plant at Twentieth and Cambridge Streets; he would open 
ﬁve more supplementary morgues. He begged military embalmers from 
the army. Pepper and Martin convinced the Brill Company, which made 
streetcars, to build thousands of simple boxes for cofﬁns, and they gath-
"
"327

ered students from embalming schools and morticians from as far as 150 
miles away. More cofﬁns came by rail, guarded by men with guns. 
And graves were dug. First the families of the dead picked up shovels 
and dug into the earth, faces streaked with sweat and tears and grit. 
For gravediggers would not work. The city’s ofﬁcial annual report notes 
that “undertakers found it impossible to hire persons willing to handle 
the bodies, owing to the decomposed nature of the same.” When Anna 
Lavin’s aunt died, “They took her to the cemetery. My father took me and 
the boy, who also had the ﬂu, and he was wrapped—my father carried 
him—wrapped in a blanket to the cemetery to say the prayer for the 
dead. . . .  The families had to dig their own graves. That was the terrible 
thing.” 
Pepper and Martin offered ten dollars a day to anyone who would 
touch a corpse, but that proved inadequate, and still the bodies piled up. 
Seminary students volunteered as gravediggers, but they still could not 
keep pace. The city and archdiocese turned to construction equipment, 
using steam shovels to dig trenches for mass graves. Michael Donohue, 
an undertaker, said, “They brought a steam shovel in to Holy Cross 
Cemetery and actually excavated. . . . They would begin bringing caskets 
in and doing the committal prayers right in the trench and they’d line 
them up right in, one right after another, this was their answer to helping 
the families get through things.” 
The bodies that were choking homes and lying in stacks in mortuar-
ies were ready to go, ﬁnally, into the ground. 
To collect them, Archbishop Denis Dougherty, installed in ofﬁce 
only a few weeks earlier—later he became the ﬁrst cardinal from the 
archdiocese—sent priests down the streets to remove bodies from homes. 
They joined the police and a few hardy others who were doing the same. 
Sometimes they collected the bodies in trucks. “So many people died 
they were instructed to ask for wooden boxes and put the corpse on the 
front porches,” recalled Harriet Ferrell. “An open truck came through the 
neighborhood and picked up the bodies. There was no place to put them, 
there was not room.” 
And sometimes they collected the bodies in wagons. Selma Epp’s 
brother Daniel died: “[P]eople were being placed on these horse-drawn 
wagons and my aunt saw the wagons pass by and he was placed on the wa-
gon; everyone was too weak to protest. There were no cofﬁns in the wagon 
"
"328 
The Great Influenza 
but the people who had died were wrapped in a sort of sackcloth and placed 
in the wagon. One was on top of the other, there were so many bodies. 
They were drawn by horses and the wagons took the bodies away.” 
No one could look at the trucks and carts carrying bodies—bodies 
wrapped in cloth stacked loosely on other bodies wrapped in cloth, arms 
and legs protruding, bodies heading for cemeteries to be buried in 
trenches—or hear the keening of the mourners and the call for the dead, 
and not think of another plague—the plague of the Middle Ages. 
Under the initial burst of energy the city seemed at ﬁrst to rally, to 
respond with vigor and courage now that leadership and organization 
seemed in place. 
But the epidemic did not abate. The street cleaning accomplished 
nothing, at least regarding inﬂuenza, and the coroner—Vare’s man— 
blamed the increasing death toll on the ban by the state public health 
commissioner on liquor sales, claiming alcohol was the best treatment 
for inﬂuenza. 
In virtually every home, someone was ill. People were already avoid-
ing each other, turning their heads away if they had to talk, isolating 
themselves. The telephone company increased the isolation: with eigh-
teen hundred telephone company employees out, the phone company 
allowed only emergency calls; operators listened to calls randomly and 
cut off phone service of those who made routine calls. And the isolation 
increased the fear. Clifford Adams recalled, “They stopped people from 
communicating, from going to churches, closed the schools, . . . closed 
all the saloons. . . . Everything was quiet.” 
Very likely half a million—possibly more—Philadelphians fell sick. It 
is impossible to be more precise: despite the new legal requirement to 
report cases, physicians were far too busy to do so, and by no means did 
physicians see all victims. Nor did nurses. 
People needed help and, notwithstanding the efforts of Emergency 
Aid, the Council of National Defense, and the Red Cross, help was 
impossible to get. 
The Inquirer blared in headlines; “Scientiﬁc Nursing Halting Epi-
demic.” 
But there were no nurses. 
"
"329 
The Tolling of the Bell 
The log of a single organization that sent out nurses noted without 
comment, “The number of calls received, 2,955, and calls not ﬁlled, 
2,758.” Calls received, 2,955; calls not ﬁlled, 2,758. And the report pointed 
out that even those numbers—93 percent of the calls unﬁlled, 7 percent 
ﬁlled—was an understatement, since the “‘calls received’ . . . does not  
represent the number of nurses required, for many of the calls were for 
several nurses to go to one place; two of the calls being for 50 nurses 
each.” 
Those nurses were needed, needed desperately. One study of ﬁfty-ﬁve 
ﬂu victims who were not hospitalized found that not one was ever seen 
by a nurse or a doctor. Ten of the ﬁfty-ﬁve patients died. 
It now seemed as if there had never been life before the epidemic. The 
disease informed every action of every person in the city. 
The archbishop released nuns for service in hospitals, including Jew-
ish hospitals, and allowed them to violate rules of their orders, to spend 
overnight away from the convent, to break vows of silence. They did not 
make a dent in the need. 
By then many of those who had earlier rushed forward to volunteer 
had withdrawn. The work was too gruesome, or too arduous, or they 
themselves fell ill. Or they too were frightened. Every day newspapers car-
ried new and increasingly desperate pleas for volunteers. 
On the single day of October 10, the epidemic alone killed 759 people 
in Philadelphia. Prior to the outbreak, deaths from all causes—all ill-
nesses, all accidents, all suicides, and all murders—averaged 485 a week. 
Fear began to break down the community of the city. Trust broke 
down. Signs began to surface of not just edginess but anger, not just ﬁnger-
pointing or protecting one’s own interests but active selﬁshness in the face 
of general calamity. The hundreds of thousands sick in the city became a 
great weight dragging upon it. And the city began to implode in chaos 
and fear. 
Pleas for volunteers became increasingly plaintive, and increasingly 
strident. Under the headline “Emergency Aid Calls for Amateur Nurses,” 
newspapers printed Mrs. Martin’s request: “In this desperate crisis the 
Emergency Aid calls on all . . . who are free from  the care of the sick at 
home and who are in good physical condition themselves . . . to report at  
"

1428 Walnut Street as early as possible Sunday morning. The ofﬁce will 
be open all day and recruits will be enrolled and immediately sent out on 
emergency work.” 
Krusen declared, “It is the duty of every well woman in the city who 
can possibly get away from her duties to volunteer for this emergency.” 
But who listened to him anymore? 
Mrs. Martin called for help from “all persons with two hands and a 
willingness to work.” 
Few came. 
On October 13, the Bureau of Child Hygiene publicly begged for 
neighbors to take in, at least temporarily, children whose parents were 
dying or dead. The response was almost nil. 
Elizabeth Martin pleaded, “We simply must have more volunteer 
helpers. . . . We have ceased caring for ordinary cases of the disease. . . .  
These people are almost all at the point of death. Won’t you ask every 
able-bodied woman in Philadelphia whether or not she has any experi-
ence in nursing to come to our help?” 
Few replied. 
The need was not only for medical care, but for care itself. Entire fam-
ilies were ill and had no one to feed them. Krusen pleaded publicly; 
“Every healthy woman in the city who can possibly be spared from her 
home can be used in ﬁghting the epidemic.” 
But by now the city had heard enough pleas, and had turned into 
itself. There was no trust, no trust, and without trust all human relations 
were breaking down. 
The professionals had continued to do their duty. One physician at 
Philadelphia Hospital, a woman, had said she was certain she was going 
to die if she remained, and ﬂed. But that was a rarity. Doctors died, and 
others kept working. Nurses died, and others kept working. Philadelphia 
Hospital had twenty student nurses from Vassar. Already two had died 
but the others “have behaved splendidly. . . . They say they will work all  
the harder.” 
Other professionals did their jobs as well. The police performed with 
heroism. Before the epidemic they had too often acted like a private army 
that owed its allegiance to the Vare machine. They had stood almost alone 
in the country against the navy’s crackdown on prostitution near military 
facilities. Yet when the police department was asked for four volunteers to 
"
"331 
The Tolling of the Bell 
“remove bodies from beds, put them in cofﬁns and load them in vehi-
cles,” when the police knew that many of those bodies had decomposed, 
118 ofﬁcers responded. 
But citizens in general had largely stopped responding. Many women 
had reported to an emergency hospital for a single shift. They had never 
returned. Some had disappeared in the middle of a shift. On October 16 
the chief nurse at the city’s largest hospital told an advisory council, 
“[V]olunteers in the wards are useless. . . .  [T]hey are afraid. Many people 
have volunteered and then refused to have anything to do with patients.” 
The attrition rate even where volunteers did not come into contact 
with the sick—in the kitchens, for example—was little better. Finally 
Mrs. Martin turned bitter and contemptuous: “Hundreds of women who 
are content to sit back . . .  had delightful dreams of themselves in the 
roles of angels of mercy, had the unfathomable vanity to imagine that 
they were capable of great spirit of sacriﬁce. Nothing seems to rouse them 
now. They have been told that there are families in which every member 
is ill, in which the children are actually starving because there is no one to 
give them food. The death rate is so high and they still hold back.” 
Susanna Turner, who did volunteer at an emergency hospital and 
stayed, who went there day after day, remembered, “The fear in the hearts 
of the people just withered them. . . . They were afraid to go out, afraid to 
do anything. . . . You  just lived from day to day, did what you had to do 
and not think about the future. . . . If you asked a neighbor for help,  they  
wouldn’t do so because they weren’t taking any chances. If they didn’t 
have it in their house, they weren’t going to bring it in there. . . . You  
didn’t have the same spirit of charity that you do with a regular time, 
when someone was sick you’d go and help them, but at that time they 
helped themselves. It was a horror-stricken time.” 
The professionals were heroes. The physicians and nurses and medical 
students and student nurses who were all dying in large numbers them-
selves held nothing of themselves back. And there were others. Ira Thomas 
played catcher for the Philadelphia Athletics. The baseball season had 
been shortened by Crowder’s “work or ﬁght” order, since sport was deemed 
unnecessary labor. Thomas’s wife was a six-foot-tall woman, large-boned, 
strong. They had no children. Day after day he carried the sick in his car 
to hospitals and she worked in an emergency hospital. Of course there 
were others. But they were few. 
"
"332 
The Great Influenza 
“Help out?” said Susanna Turner. “They weren’t going to risk it, they 
just refused because they were so panic-stricken, they really were, they 
feared their relatives would die because so many did die—they just 
dropped dead.” No one could buy things. Commodities dealers, coal 
dealers, grocers closed “because the people who dealt in them were either 
sick or afraid and they had reason to be afraid.” 
During the week of October 16 alone, 4,597 Philadelphians died from 
inﬂuenza or pneumonia, and inﬂuenza killed still more indirectly. That 
would be the worst week of the epidemic. But no one knew that at the 
time. Krusen had too often said the peak had passed. The press had too 
often spoken of triumph over disease. 
Even war industries, despite the massive propaganda campaigns telling 
workers victory depended upon their production, saw massive absences. 
Anna Lavin said, “We didn’t work. Couldn’t go to work. Nobody came 
into work.” Even those who weren’t sick “stayed in. They were all afraid.” 
Between 20 and 40 percent of the workers at Baldwin Locomotive, at 
Midvale Steel, at Sun Shipbuilding, each plant employing thousands, were 
absent. At virtually every large employer, huge percentages of employees 
were absent. Thirty-eight hundred Pennsylvania Railroad workers were 
out. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad set up its own emergency hospi-
tals along its tracks. The entire transportation system for the mid-
Atlantic region staggered and trembled, putting in jeopardy most of the 
nation’s industrial output. 
The city was breaking apart. Orphans were already becoming a prob-
lem. Social service agencies that tried but fell short in their efforts to 
deliver food and transport people to hospitals began to plan for the 
orphans as well.

hat was happening in Philadelphia was happening every-
where. In that densely populated city, Isaac Starr had counted not 
a single other car on the road in his twelve-mile drive from the city cen-
ter home. And on the other side of the world, the same experiences—the 
deaths, the terror, the reluctance to help, the silence—were replicated. 
Alfred Hollows was in Wellington, New Zealand: “I was detailed to an 
emergency hospital in Abel Smith Street. It was a hall . . . staffed by 
women volunteers.” They had sixty beds. “Our death rate was really quite 
appalling—something like a dozen a day—and the women volunteers 
just disappeared, and weren’t seen again. . . . I stood in  the middle of 
Wellington City at 2 p.m. on a weekday afternoon, and there was not a 
soul to be seen—no trams running, no shops open, and the only trafﬁc 
was a van with a white sheet tied to the side, with a big red cross painted 
on it, serving as an ambulance or hearse. It was really a City of the Dead.” 
In New York City at Presbyterian Hospital, each morning on rounds 
Dr. Dana Atchley was astounded, and frightened, to see that, for what 
seemed to him an eternity, every single patient—every one—in the criti-
cal section had died overnight. 
The federal government was giving no guidance that a reasoning per-
son could credit. Few local governments did better. They left a vacuum. 
Fear ﬁlled it. 
The government’s very efforts to preserve “morale” fostered the fear, 
"
"334 
The Great Influenza 
for since the war began, morale—deﬁned in the narrowest, most short-
sighted fashion—had taken precedence in every public utterance. As Cal-
ifornia senator Hiram Johnson said in 1917, “The ﬁrst casualty when war 
comes is truth.” 
It was a time when the phrase “brisk ﬁghting” meant that more than 
50 percent of a unit was killed or wounded; a time when the memoir of a 
nurse at the front, published in 1916, was withdrawn by her publisher 
after America entered the war because she told the truth about gruesome 
conditions; a time when newspapers insisted, “There is plenty of gasoline 
and oil for automobile use,” even while gas stations were ordered to close 
“voluntarily” at night and Sundays and a national campaign was being 
waged against driving on “gasless Sundays”—and police pulled over 
motorists who did not “voluntarily” comply. 
Newspapers reported on the disease with the same mixture of truth 
and half-truth, truth and distortion, truth and lies with which they reported 
everything else. And no national ofﬁcial ever publicly acknowledged the 
danger of inﬂuenza. 
But in the medical community, deep concern had arisen. Welch of 
course had initially feared that it might be a new disease, although he 
soon recognized it as inﬂuenza. Many serious pathologists in Germany 
and Switzerland considered the possibility of plague. The director of the 
laboratory at Bellevue Hospital wondered in the Journal of the American 
Medical Association if “the world is facing” not a pandemic of an extraor-
dinarily lethal inﬂuenza but instead a mild version of plague, noting,“The 
similarity of the two diseases is enforced by the clinical features, which are 
remarkably alike in many respects, and by the pathology of certain tissues 
other than the lungs.” 
What pathologists said in medical journals physicians muttered to 
each other, while laymen and -women watched a husband or wife turn-
ing almost black. And a great chill settled over the land, a chill of fear. 
Meanwhile, William Park sat in his laboratory amid petri dishes, dis-
sected mice, and cultures of pathogens, and quoted Daniel Defoe’s Jour-
nal of the Plague Year: “In the whole the face of things, as I say, was much 
altered; sorrow and sadness sat upon every face; and though some parts 
were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned; and as we 
saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked on himself and his fam-
ily as in the utmost danger.”

As terrifying as the disease was, the press made it more so. They terriﬁed 
by making little of it, for what ofﬁcials and the press said bore no relation-
ship to what people saw and touched and smelled and endured. People 
could not trust what they read. Uncertainty follows distrust, fear follows 
uncertainty, and, under conditions such as these, terror follows fear. 
When inﬂuenza struck in Massachusetts, the nearby Providence Journal 
reported; “All the hospital beds at the forts at Boston harbor are occupied 
by inﬂuenza patients. . . . There are  3,500 cases at Camp Devens.” Yet the 
paper asserted, “Such reports may actually be reassuring rather than alarm-
ing. The soldier or sailor goes to bed if he is told to, just as he goes on sen-
try duty. He may not think he is sick, and he may be right about it, but the 
military doctor is not to be argued with and at this time the autocrat is 
not permitting the young men under his charge to take any chance.” 
As the virus infested the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, the Asso-
ciated Press reported, “To dispel alarm caused throughout the country by 
exaggerated stories . . . Captain W. A. Moffat, commandant, gave out the 
statement today that while there are about 4,500 cases of the disease 
among the 45,000 blue jackets at the station, the situation in general is 
much improved. The death rate has been only one and one half per cent, 
which is below the death rate in the east.” 
That report was meant to reassure. It is unlikely that it did so, even 
though it omitted the fact that quarantines were being imposed upon the 
training station, the adjoining Great Lakes Aviation Camp, and the 
nearby Fort Sheridan army cantonment, which, combined, amounted to 
the largest military concentration in the country. And military authori-
ties of course assured both civilians nearby as well as the country at large 
that “the epidemic is on the wane.” 
Over and over in hundreds of newspapers, day after day, repeated in 
one form or another people read Rupert Blue’s reassurance as well: 
“There is no cause for alarm if precautions are observed.” 
They read the words of Colonel Philip Doane, the ofﬁcer in charge of 
health at the country’s shipyards, who told the Associated Press, “The so-
called Spanish inﬂuenza is nothing more or less than old fashioned grippe.” 
Those words, too, ran in hundreds of newspapers. But people could 
smell death in them. Then they came to know that death. 
Immediately outside Little Rock lay Camp Pike, where eight thousand 
"
"336 
The Great Influenza 
cases were admitted to the hospital in four days and the camp comman-
dant stopped releasing the names of the dead. “You ought to see this hos-
pital tonight,” wrote Francis Blake, one of four members of the army’s 
pneumonia commission at Pike. “Every corridor and there are miles of 
them with a double row of cots and every ward nearly with an extra row 
down the middle with inﬂuenza patients and lots of barracks about the 
camp turned into emergency inﬁrmaries and the Camp closed. . . . There  
is only death and destruction.” 
The camp called upon Little Rock for nurses, doctors, linens, and 
cofﬁns, all while within the city the Arkansas Gazette declared in head-
lines, “Spanish inﬂuenza is plain la grippe—same old fever and chills.” 
Outside Des Moines, Iowa, at Camp Dodge, also, inﬂuenza was killing 
hundreds of young soldiers. Within the city a group called the Greater 
Des Moines Committee, businessmen and professionals who had taken 
charge during the emergency, included the city attorney who warned 
publishers—and his warning carried the sting of potential prosecution— 
“I would recommend that if anything be printed in regard to the disease 
it be conﬁned to simple preventive measures—something constructive 
rather than destructive.” Another committee member, a physician, said, 
“There is no question that by a right attitude of the mind these people 
have kept themselves from illness. I have no doubt that many persons 
have contracted the disease through fear. . . . Fear is the ﬁrst thing to be 
overcome, the ﬁrst step in conquering this epidemic.” 
The Bronxville, New York, Review Press and Reporter simply said 
nothing at all about inﬂuenza, absolutely nothing, until October 4, when 
it reported that the “scourge” had claimed its ﬁrst victim there. It was as 
if the scourge had come from nowhere; yet even the paper recognized 
that, without its printing a word, everyone knew of it. And even as the 
epidemic rooted itself in Bronxville, the paper condemned “alarmism” 
and warned, “Fear kills more than the disease and the weak and timid 
often succumb ﬁrst.” 
Fear, that was the enemy. Yes, fear. And the more ofﬁcials tried to con-
trol it with half-truths and outright lies, the more the terror spread. 
The Los Angeles public health director said, “If ordinary precautions are 
observed there is no cause for alarm.” Forty-eight hours later he closed all 
places of public gatherings, including schools, churches, and theaters. 
"
"337 
The Tolling of the Bell 
The Illinois superintendent of public health had—privately, in a con-
ﬁdential meeting with other Illinois public health ofﬁcials and Chicago 
politicians—suggested they close all places of business to save lives. Chi-
cago Public Health Commissioner John Dill Robertson violently rejected 
that suggestion as unwarranted and very damaging to morale. In his ofﬁ-
cial report on the epidemic, he bragged, “Nothing was done to interfere 
with the morale of the community.” Later he explained to other public 
health professionals, “It is our duty to keep the people from fear. Worry 
kills more people than the epidemic.” 
The mortality rate at Cook County Hospital for all inﬂuenza cases— 
not just those who developed pneumonia—was 39.8 percent. 
Literary Digest, one of the largest-circulation periodicals in the coun-
try, advised, “Fear is our ﬁrst enemy.” 
“Don’t Get Scared!” was the advice printed in virtually every newspa-
per in the country, in large, blocked-off parts of pages labeled “Advice on 
How to Avoid Inﬂuenza.” 
The Albuquerque Morning Journal issued instructions on “How to 
Dodge ‘Flu.’” The most prominent advice was the usual: “Don’t Get 
Scared.” Almost daily it repeated, “Don’t Let Flu Frighten You to Death,” 
“Don’t Panic.” 
In Phoenix the Arizona Republican monitored inﬂuenza from a dis-
tance. On September 22 it declared “Dr. W. C. Woodward of the Boston 
Health Department assumed an optimistic attitude tonight. . . . Dr.  
Woodward said the increase in cases today was not alarming.” At Camp 
Dix “the camp medical authorities asserted they have the epidemic under 
control.” And the paper noted the ﬁrst inﬂuenza deaths in New Orleans 
two days before the New Orleans daily newspaper the Item mentioned 
any death in the city. 
But after the ﬁrst case appeared in Phoenix itself, the Republican fell 
silent, utterly silent, saying nothing about inﬂuenza anyplace in the country 
until the news was such that it could no longer keep silent. Its competitor 
the Gazette competed in reassurances, quoting local physician Herman 
Randall saying, “Ten people sit in the same draught, are exposed to the 
same microbes. Some will suffer and perhaps die, while the others go scot 
free. . . .  The people during an epidemic who are most fearful are usually, 
on the testimony of physicians, the ﬁrst ones to succumb to the disease.” 
And in Phoenix, even after the war ended, the “Citizens’ Committee” that 
"
"338 
The Great Influenza 
had taken over the city during the emergency continued to impose 
silence, ordering that “merchants of the city refrain from mentioning the 
inﬂuenza epidemic directly or indirectly in their advertising.” 
Meanwhile, Vicks VapoRub advertisements in hundreds of papers 
danced down the delicate line of reassurance while promising relief, call-
ing the epidemic, “Simply the Old-Fashioned Grip Masquerading Under 
a New Name.” 
Some papers experimented in controlling fear by printing almost 
nothing at all. In Goldsboro, North Carolina, recalls a survivor, “The 
papers didn’t even want to publish the lists of names [of the dead]. . . .  
The information about who was dying had to come up through the 
grapevine, verbally, from one person to the other.” 
A historian studying Buffalo County, Nebraska, expressed puzzle-
ment that “[t]he county newspapers manifested a curious reticence 
regarding the effects of inﬂuenza, perhaps most evident in the The Kear-
ney Hub. It may be surmised that the editors played down the severity of 
the problem to discourage the onset of general panic in the face of what 
was a thoroughly frightening situation.”As late as December 14 that paper 
was telling people not to “get panicky,” telling them city ofﬁcials were 
“not inclined to be as panicky as a great many citizens.” 
How could one not get panicky? Even before people’s neighbors began to 
die, before bodies began to pile up in each new community, every piece 
of information except the newspapers told the truth. Even while Blue 
recited his mantra—There is no cause for alarm if proper precautions are 
taken—he was calling upon local authorities to “close all public gathering 
places, if their community is threatened with the epidemic. This will do 
much toward checking the spread of the disease.” Even if Colonel Doane 
had said Inﬂuenza is nothing more or less than old fashioned grippe, news-
papers also quoted him saying, “Every person who spits is helping the 
Kaiser.” 
And even while Blue and Doane, governors and mayors, and nearly all 
the newspapers insisted that this was inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza, the Pub-
lic Health Service was making a massive effort to distribute advice— 
nearly useless advice. It prepared ready-to-print plates and sent them to 
ten thousand newspapers, most of which did print them. It prepared— 
"
"339

the Red Cross paid for printing and distribution—posters and pam-
phlets, including six million copies of a single circular. Teachers handed 
them out in schools; bosses stacked them in stores, post ofﬁces, and fac-
tories; Boy Scouts stuffed them into tens of thousands of doorways; min-
isters referred to them on Sundays; mailmen carried them to rural free 
delivery boxes; city workers pasted posters to walls. 
But a Public Health Service warning to avoid crowds came too late to 
do much good, and the only advice of any real use remained the same: 
that those who felt sick should go to bed immediately and stay there sev-
eral days after all symptoms disappeared. Everything else in Blue’s circu-
lars was so general as to be pointless. Yet all over the country, newspapers 
printed again and again: “Remember the 3 Cs, clean mouth, clean skin, 
and clean clothes. . . . Keep the bowels open. . . .  Food will win the  
war. . . .  [H]elp by choosing and chewing your food well.” 
The Journal of the American Medical Association knew better. It dis-
missed the public reassurances and warned, “The danger to life from 
inﬂuenza in this epidemic is so grave that it is imperative to secure from 
the individual patient the most complete isolation.” And it attacked “cur-
rent advice and instructions to the public from the ofﬁcial and other 
sources”—Blue’s advice, the advice from local public-health ofﬁcials 
downplaying everything—as useless and dangerous. 
“Don’t Get Scared!” said the newspapers. 
Meanwhile people read—those in the West seeing it before the virus 
reached them—the Red Cross appeals published in newspapers, often 
in half-page advertisements that said; “The safety of this country de-
mands that all patriotic available nurses, nurses’ aids [sic] or anyone with 
experience in nursing place themselves at once under the disposal of the 
Government. . . . Physicians are urgently requested to release from atten-
dance on chronic cases and all other cases which are not critically ill every 
nurse working under their direction who can possibly be spared for such 
duty. Graduate nurses, undergraduates, nurses’ aids, and volunteers are 
urged  to  telegraph  collect  at  once . . . to  their local Red Cross chapter or 
Red Cross headquarters, Washington, D.C.” 
“Don’t Get Scared!” said the papers. 
Be not afraid. 
But not everyone was ready to trust in God.

In 2001 a terrorist attack with anthrax killed ﬁve people and transﬁxed 
America. In 2002 an outbreak of West Nile virus killed 284 people 
nationally in six months and sparked headlines for weeks, along with 
enough fear to change people’s behavior. In 2003 SARS killed over eight 
hundred people around the world, froze Asian economies, and fright-
ened millions of people in Hong Kong, Singapore, and elsewhere into 
wearing masks on the streets. 
In 1918 fear moved ahead of the virus like the bow wave before a ship. 
Fear drove the people, and the government and the press could not con-
trol it. They could not control it because every true report had been 
diluted with lies. And the more the ofﬁcials and newspapers reassured, 
the more they said, There is no cause for alarm if proper precautions are 
taken, or Inﬂuenza is nothing more or less than old-fashioned grippe, the 
more people believed themselves cast adrift, adrift with no one to trust, 
adrift on an ocean of death. 
So people watched the virus approach, and feared, feeling as impotent 
as it moved toward them as if it were an inexorable oncoming cloud of 
poison gas. It was a thousand miles away, ﬁve hundred miles away, ﬁfty 
miles away, twenty miles away. 
In late September they saw published reports, reports buried in back 
pages, reports in tiny paragraphs, but reports nonetheless: eight hundred 
cases among midshipmen at Annapolis . . . in New  York  State coughing or 
sneezing without covering the face was now punishable by a year in jail 
and a $500 ﬁne . . .  thirty cases of inﬂuenza among students at the Uni-
versity of Colorado—but, of course, the Associated Press reassured, 
“None of the cases, it was said, is serious.” 
But then it was serious: four hundred dead in a day in Philadel-
phia . . . twenty dead in Colorado and New Mexico . . . four hundred 
now dead in Chicago . . . all social and amusement activities suspended 
in El Paso, where seven funerals for soldiers occurred in a single day (it 
would get much worse) . . . a terrible outbreak in Winslow, Arizona. 
It was like being bracketed by artillery, the barrage edging closer and 
closer. 
In Lincoln, Illinois, a small town thirty miles from Springﬁeld, Wil-
liam Maxwell sensed it: “My ﬁrst intimations about the epidemic was that

it was something happening to the troops. There didn’t seem to be any 
reason to think it would ever have anything to do with us. And yet in a 
gradual remorseless way it kept moving closer and closer. Rumors of the 
alarming situation reached this very small town in the midwest. . . . It was  
like, almost like an entity moving closer.” 
In Meadow, Utah, one hundred miles from Provo, Lee Reay recalled, 
“We were very concerned in our town because it was moving south down 
the highway, and we were next.” They watched it kill in Payson, then San-
taguin, then Nephi, Levan, and Mills. They watched it come closer and 
closer. They put up a huge sign on the road that ordered people to keep 
going, not to stop in Meadow. But the mailman stopped anyway. 
Wherever one was in the country, it crept closer—it was in the next 
town, the next neighborhood, the next block, the next room. In Tucson 
the Arizona Daily Star warned readers not to catch “Spanish hysteria!” 
“Don’t worry!” was the ofﬁcial and ﬁnal piece of advice on how to avoid 
the disease from the Arizona Board of Health. 
Don’t get scared! said the newspapers everywhere. Don’t get scared! 
they said in Denver, in Seattle, in Detroit; in Burlington, Vermont, and 
Burlington, Iowa, and Burlington, North Carolina; in Greenville. Rhode 
Island, and Greenville, South Carolina, and Greenville, Mississippi. And 
every time the newspapers said, Don’t get scared! they frightened. 
The virus had moved west and south from the East Coast by water 
and rail. It rose up in great crests to ﬂood cities, rolled in great waves 
through the towns, broke into wild rivers to rage through villages, poured 
in swollen creeks through settlements, ﬂowed in tiny rivulets into iso-
lated homes. And as in a great ﬂood it covered everything, varying in 
depth but covering everything, settling over the land in a great leveling. 
Albert Camus wrote, “What’s true of all the evils in the world is true of 
plague as well. It helps men to rise above themselves.” 
One who rose was Dr. Ralph Marshall Ward, who had abandoned 
medicine for cattle ranching. Leaving medicine had not been a business 
decision. 
An intellectual, particularly interested in pharmacology, he was a 
prominent physician in Kansas City with an ofﬁce and pharmacy in the 
Stockyard Exchange Building down by the bottoms. But Kansas City was

a major railhead, with the yards near his ofﬁce. Most of his practice 
involved treating railroad workers injured in accidents. He performed 
huge numbers of amputations, and seemed always to work on mangled 
men, men ripped into pieces by steel. To have a practice with so much 
human agony ripped him into pieces as well. 
He had too much of doctoring, and, from treating cowboys hurt on 
cattle drives north to Kansas City, he had learned enough about the cattle 
business that he decided shortly before the war to buy a small ranch more 
than a thousand miles away, near San Benito, Texas, close to the Mexican 
border. On the long trip south, he and his wife made a pact never to utter 
a word that he had been a doctor. But in October 1918, inﬂuenza reached 
him. Some ranch hands got ill. He began treating them. Word spread. 
A few days later his wife woke up to a disturbing and unrecognizable 
sound. She went outside and saw out there in the gloaming people, hun-
dreds of people, on the horizon. They seemed to cover that horizon, and 
as they came closer, it was clear they were Mexicans, a few of them on mules, 
most on foot, women carrying babies, men carrying women, bedraggled, 
beaten down, a mass of humanity, a mass of horror and suffering. She 
yelled for her husband, and he came out and stood on the porch. “Oh my 
God!” he said. 
The people had come with nothing. But they knew he was a doctor so 
they had come. The Wards later told their granddaughter it was like the 
hospital scene in Gone With the Wind, with rows of wounded and dying 
laid out on the ground in agony. These people had come with nothing, 
had nothing, and they were dying. The Wards took huge pots outside to 
boil water, used all their resources to feed them, treated them. Out on the 
empty harsh range near the Mexican border, they had no Red Cross to 
turn to for help, no Council of National Defense. They did what they 
could, and it ruined them. He went back to Kansas City; he had already 
gone back to being a doctor. 
There were other men and women like the Wards. Physicians, nurses, 
scientists—did their jobs, and the virus killed them, killed them in such 
numbers that each week JAMA was ﬁlled with literally page after page after 
page after page after page of nothing but brief obituaries in tiny com-
pressed type. Hundreds of doctors dying. Hundreds. Others helped too.

But as Camus knew, evil and crises do not make all men rise above 
themselves. Crises only make them discover themselves. And some dis-
cover a less inspiring humanity. 
As the crest of the wave that broke over Philadelphia began its sweep 
across the rest of the country, it was accompanied by the same terror 
that had silenced the streets there. Most men and women sacriﬁced and 
risked their lives only for those they loved most deeply: a child, a wife, a 
husband. Others, loving chieﬂy themselves, ﬂed in terror even from them. 
Still others fomented terror, believing that blaming the enemy— 
Germany—could help the war effort, or perhaps actually believing that 
Germany was responsible. Doane himself charged that “German agents . . .  
from submarines” brought inﬂuenza to the United States. “The Germans 
have started epidemics in Europe, and there is no reason why they should 
be particularly gentle to America.” 
Others around the country echoed him. Starkville, Mississippi, a 
town of three thousand in the Mississippi hill country, was built around 
a sawmill, cotton farms—not the rich, lush plantations of the Delta but 
harsh land—and Mississippi A&M College (now Mississippi State Uni-
versity). It served as headquarters for Dr. M. G. Parsons, the U.S. Public 
Health Service ofﬁcer for northeastern Mississippi, who proudly informed 
Blue that he had succeeded in getting local newspapers to run stories he 
made up that “aid in forming a proper frame of mind” in the public. That 
frame of mind was fear. Parsons wanted to create fear, believing it “pre-
pared the public mind to receive and act on our suggestions.” 
Parsons got the local press to say, “The Hun resorts to unwanted mur-
der of innocent noncombatants. . . . He  has been tempted to spread sick-
ness and death thru germs, and has done so in authenticated cases. . . .  
Communicable diseases are more strictly a weapon for use well back of 
the lines, over on French or British, or American land.” Blue neither rep-
rimanded Parsons for fomenting fear nor suggested that he take another 
tack. Another story read, “The Germs Are Coming. An epidemic of 
inﬂuenza is spreading or being spread, (we wonder which).” . . .  
Those and similar charges created enough public sentiment to force 
Public Health Service laboratories to waste valuable time and energy 
investigating such possible agents of germ warfare as Bayer aspirin. Par-
sons’s territory bordered on Alabama and there a traveling salesman from

Philadelphia named H. M. Thomas was arrested on suspicion of being a 
German agent and spreading inﬂuenza—death. Thomas was released, 
but on October 17, the day after inﬂuenza had killed 759 people in 
Philadelphia, his body was found in a hotel room with his wrists cut— 
and his throat slit. Police ruled it suicide. 
Everywhere, as in Philadelphia, two problems developed: caring for the 
sick, and maintaining some kind of order. 
In Cumberland, Maryland, a gritty railroad and industrial city in the 
heart of a coal-mining region—where one actually could throw a stone 
across the Potomac River into West Virginia—to prevent the spread of 
the disease schools and churches had already been closed, all public gath-
ering places had been closed, and stores had been ordered to close early. 
Nonetheless, the epidemic exploded on October 5. At noon that day the 
local Red Cross chairman met with the treasurer of the Red Cross’s War 
Fund and the head of the local Council of National Defense. Their con-
clusion: “The matter seemed far beyond control. . . . Reports were  
spreading fast that ‘this one’ or ‘that one’ had died without doctor or 
nurse and it was a panic indeed.” 
They decided to convert two large buildings on Washington Street to 
emergency hospitals. From there a handful of women took over, meeting 
barely an hour after the men had. Each woman had a task: to gather 
linens, or bathroom supplies, or cooking utensils, or ﬂour. They worked 
fast. The next morning the hospitals ﬁlled with patients. 
In Cumberland, 41 percent of the entire population got sick. But the 
emergency hospitals had only three nurses. The organizers begged for 
more: “We notiﬁed the Bd of Health we must have more nurses if we were 
to  go  on. . . . [Nurses] promised. However this help never materialized 
and up to date . . . 93  admissions, 18 deaths. The question of orderlies is 
difﬁcult. They are just not to be found.” 
Back in Starkville, Parsons met with the president of the college, the 
army commander of the students—all the students had been inducted 
into the army—and physicians. “We had an open discussion of the dan-
gers and best actions to take and they assured me everything possible 
would be done,” he wired Blue. He asked for and received ﬁfteen thou-
sand pamphlets, posters, and circulars, more than the combined pop-
ulation of Starkville, Columbus, and West Point. But he, and they, 
"

accomplished little. Of eighteen hundred students, well over half would 
get inﬂuenza. On October 9 Parsons “found unbelievable conditions 
with everybody in power stunned.” At that moment eight hundred stu-
dents were sick and 2 percent of all students had already died, with many 
deaths to come. Parsons found “inﬂuenza is all thru the region, in town, 
hamlet, and single home. People are pretty well scared, with reason. . . .” 
In West Point, a town of ﬁve thousand, ﬁfteen hundred were ill simulta-
neously. Parsons confessed, “Panic incipient.” 
In El Paso a U.S. Public Health Service ofﬁcer reported to Blue, “I have 
the honor to inform you that from Oct 9th to date there have been 275 
deaths from inﬂuenza in El Paso among civilians. This does not include 
civilians who are employed by the government and who died at the base 
hospital of Fort Bliss, nor does it include soldiers . . .  [W]hole city in a 
panic.” 
In Colorado, towns in the San Juan Mountains did not panic. They 
turned grimly serious. They had time to prepare. Lake City guards kept 
the town entirely free of the disease, allowing no one to enter. Silverton, a 
town of two thousand, authorized closing businesses even before a single 
case surfaced. But the virus snuck in, with a vengeance. In a single week 
in Silverton, 125 died. The town of Ouray set up a “shot gun quarantine,” 
hiring guards to keep miners from Silverton and Telluride out. But the 
virus reached Ouray as well. 
It had not reached Gunnison. Neither tiny nor isolated, Gunnison was 
a railroad town, a supply center for the west-central part of the state, the 
home of Western State Teachers College. In early October—far in advance 
of any cases of inﬂuenza—Gunnison and most neighboring towns issued 
a closing order and a ban on public gatherings. Then Gunnison decided 
to isolate itself entirely. Gunnison lawmen blocked all through roads. 
Train conductors warned all passengers that if they stepped foot on the 
platform in Gunnison to stretch their legs, they would be arrested and 
quarantined for ﬁve days. Two Nebraskans trying simply to drive through 
to a town in the next county ran the blockade and were thrown into jail. 
Meanwhile, the nearby town of Sargents suffered six deaths in a single 
day—out of a total population of 130. 
Early in the epidemic, back on September 27—it seemed like years 
before—the Wisconsin newspaper the Jefferson County Union had re-
ported the truth about the disease, and the general in charge of the Army 
"
"346 
The Great Influenza 
Morale Branch decreed the report “depressant to morale” and forwarded 
it to enforcement ofﬁcials for “any action which may be deemed appro-
priate,” including criminal prosecution. Now, weeks later, after weeks of 
dying and with the war over, the Gunnison News-Chronicle, unlike virtu-
ally every other newspaper in the country, played no games and warned, 
“This disease is no joke, to be made light of, but a terrible calamity.” 
Gunnison escaped without a death. 
In the United States, the war was something over there. The epidemic was 
here. 
“Even if there was war,” recalled Susanna Turner of Philadelphia, “the 
war was removed from us, you know . . . on  the other side. . . .  This 
malignancy, it was right at our very doors.” 
People feared and hated this malignancy, this alien thing in their 
midst. They were willing to cut it out at any cost. In Goldsboro, North 
Carolina, Dan Tonkel recalled, “We were actually almost afraid to breathe, 
the theaters were closed down so you didn’t get into any crowds. . . . You  
felt like you were walking on eggshells, you were afraid even to go out. 
You couldn’t play with your playmates, your classmates, your neighbors, 
you had to stay home and just be careful. The fear was so great people 
were actually afraid to leave their homes. People were actually afraid to 
talk to one another. It was almost like don’t breathe in my face, don’t look 
at me and breathe in my face. . . . You never  knew from day to day who 
was going to be next on the death list. . . . That was the horrible part, 
people just died so quickly.” 
His father had a store. Four of eight salesgirls died. “Farmers stopped 
farming and the merchants stopped selling merchandise and the country 
really more or less just shut down holding their breath. Everyone was 
holding their breath.” His uncle Benny was nineteen years old and had 
been living with him until he was drafted and went to Fort Bragg, which 
sent him home when he reported. The camp was refusing all new 
draftees. Tonkel recalls his parents not wanting to allow Benny back in 
the house. “‘Benny we don’t know what to do with you,’” they said. 
“‘Well, what can I tell you. I’m here,’” his uncle replied. They let him in. 
“We were frightened, yes absolutely, we were frightened.” 
In Washington, D.C., William Sardo said, “It kept people apart. . . . It  
took away all your community life, you had no community life, you had 
"
"347 
The Tolling of the Bell 
no school life, you had no church life, you had nothing. . . . It completely 
destroyed all family and community life. People were afraid to kiss one 
another, people were afraid to eat with one another, they were afraid to 
have anything that made contact because that’s how you got the ﬂu. . . .  
It destroyed those contacts and destroyed the intimacy that existed 
amongst  people. . . . You were constantly afraid, you were afraid because 
you saw so much death around you, you were surrounded by death. . . .  
When each day dawned you didn’t know whether you would be there 
when the sun set that day. It wiped out entire families from the time that 
the day began in the morning to bedtime at night—entire families were 
gone completely, there wasn’t any single soul left and that didn’t happen 
just intermittently, it happened all the way across the neighborhoods, 
it was a terrifying experience. It justiﬁably should be called a plague 
because that’s what it was. . . . You were quarantined, is what you were, 
from fear, it was so quick, so sudden. . . . There  was an aura of a constant 
fear that you lived through from getting up in the morning to going to 
bed at night.” 
In New Haven, Connecticut, John Delano recalled the same isolating 
fear: “Normally when someone was sick in those days the parents, the 
mothers, the fathers, would bring food over to other families but this was 
very  weird. . . . Nobody  was coming in, nobody would bring food in, 
nobody came to visit.” 
Prescott, Arizona, made it illegal to shake hands. In Perry County, 
Kentucky, in the mountains where men either dug into the earth for coal 
or scratched upon the earth’s surface trying to farm despite topsoil only 
a few inches deep, a county of hard people, where family ties bound 
tightly, where men and women were loyal and would murder for pride or 
honor, the Red Cross chapter chairman begged for help, reporting “hun-
dreds of cases up in mountains that they were unable to reach.” They 
were unreachable not just because the county had almost no roads; 
streambeds in dry weather substituted for them and when the stream-
beds ﬁlled, transport became impossible. It was more: “People starving to 
death not from lack of food but because the well were panic stricken and 
would not go near the sick; that in the stricken families the dead were 
lying uncared for.” Doctors were offered $100 to come out and stay there 
one hour. None came. Even one Red Cross worker, Morgan Brawner, 
arrived in the county Saturday and left Sunday, himself terror stricken. 
"
"348 
The Great Influenza 
He had reason to fear: in some areas the civilian mortality rate reached 30 
percent. 
In Norwood, Massachusetts, a historian years later interviewed sur-
vivors. One man, a newsboy in 1918, remembered that his manager 
would “tell me to put the money on the table and he’d spray the money 
before he’d pick it up.” Said another survivor; “There wasn’t much visit-
ing. . . . We stayed by  ourselves.” And another: “[H]e’d bring, you know, 
whatever my father needed and leave it on the doorstep. No one would go 
into each other’s houses.” And another: “Everything came to a stand-
still. . . . We weren’t allowed out  the door. We had to keep away from 
people.” And another: “A cop, a big burly guy . . . came up to the house 
and nailed a big white sign and on the sign it said influenza in red letters. 
And they nailed it to the door.” A sign made a family even more isolated. 
And another survivor: “I’d go up the street, walk up the street with my 
hand over my eyes because there were so many houses with crepe draped 
over the doors.” And still another: “It was horrifying. Not only were you 
frightened you might come down with it but there was the eerie feeling of 
people passing away all around you.” 
In Luce County, Michigan, one woman was nursing her husband and 
three boys when she “came down with it herself,” reported a Red Cross 
worker. “Not one of the neighbors would come in and help. I stayed there 
all night, and in the morning telephoned the woman’s sister. She came 
and tapped on the window, but refused to talk to me until she had gotten 
a safe distance away. . . . I could do nothing for the woman . . . except  
send for the priest.” 
Monument and Ignacio, Colorado, went further than banning all 
public gatherings. They banned customers from stores; the stores remained 
open, but customers shouted orders through doors, then waited outside 
for packages. 
Colorado Springs placarded homes with signs that read “Sickness.” 
In no industry did workers hear more about patriotism, about how their 
work mattered to the war effort as much as that of soldiers ﬁghting at 
the front, than in shipbuilding. Nor were workers in any industry more 
carefully attended to. In all plants common drinking cups were immedi-
ately destroyed, replaced by tens of thousands of paper cups. Hospital 
and treatment facilities were arranged in advance, inﬂuenza vaccine sup-
"

plied, and it was perhaps the only industry in which nurses and doctors 
remained available. As a result, claimed a Public Health Service ofﬁcer, 
“There is no reason to believe that many men were absent from work 
through panic or fear of the disease, because our educational program 
took care to avoid frightening the men. The men were taught that they 
were safer at work than any where else.” 
They were also of course not paid unless they came to work. But at 
dozens of shipyards in New England, the absentee records were striking. 
At the L. H. Shattuck Company, 45.9 percent of the workers stayed home. 
At the George A. Gilchrist yard, 54.3 percent stayed home. At Freeport 
Shipbuilding, 57 percent stayed home. At Groton Iron Works, 58.3 per-
cent stayed home. 
Twenty-six hundred miles away was Phoenix, Arizona. At the begin-
ning of the epidemic its newspapers had behaved as did those everywhere 
else, saying little, reassuring, insisting that fear was more dangerous than 
the disease. But the virus took its time there, lingered longer than else-
where, lingered until ﬁnally even the press expressed fear. On November 
8 the Arizona Republican warned, “The people of Phoenix are facing a 
crisis. The [epidemic] has reached such serious proportions that it is the 
ﬁrst problem before the people. . . . Almost every home in the city has 
been stricken with the plague. . . . Fearless men and women [must] serve 
in the cause of humanity.” 
The war was three days from ending, and several false peaces had been 
announced. Still, for that newspaper to call inﬂuenza “the ﬁrst problem” 
while the war continued was extraordinary. And ﬁnally the city formed a 
“citizens’ committee” to take charge. 
In Arizona, citizens’ committees were taken seriously. A year earlier 
ﬁfteen hundred armed members of a “Citizens Protective League” had 
put 1,221 striking miners into cattle and boxcars and abandoned them 
without food or water on a railroad siding in the desert, across the New 
Mexico line. In Phoenix another “citizens’ committee” had been going 
after “bond slackers,” hanging them in efﬁgy on main streets. One man 
refused to buy a bond because of religious reasons. Nonetheless he was 
hung in efﬁgy with a placard reading, “H. G. Saylor, yellow slacker. . . .  
Can, but won’t buy a liberty bond!” Saylor was lucky. The committee also 
seized Charles Reas, a carpenter, tied his hands behind his back, painted 
his face yellow, put a noose around his neck, and dragged him through 
"
"350 
The Great Influenza 
downtown Phoenix streets wearing a sign that read “with this exception 
we are 100%.” 
The inﬂuenza Citizens’ Committee took similar initiatives. It depu-
tized a special police force and also called upon all “patriotic citizens” to 
enforce anti-inﬂuenza ordinances, including requiring every person in 
public to wear a mask, arresting anyone who spit or coughed without 
covering his mouth, dictating that businesses (those that remained open) 
give twelve hundred cubic feet of air space to each customer, and halting 
all trafﬁc into the city and allowing only those with “actual business here” 
to enter. Soon the Republican described “a city of masked faces, a city as 
grotesque as a masked carnival.” 
And yet—ironically—inﬂuenza touched Phoenix only lightly com-
pared to elsewhere. The panic came anyway. Dogs told the story of terror, 
but not with their barking. Rumors spread that dogs carried inﬂuenza. 
The police began killing all dogs on the street. And people began killing 
their own dogs, dogs they loved, and if they had not the heart to kill them 
themselves, they gave them to the police to be killed. “At this death rate 
from causes other than natural,” reported the Gazette, “Phoenix will soon 
be dogless.” Back in Philadelphia Mary Volz lived near a church. She had 
always “loved to hear the church bells ringing, they were so jubilantly 
ringing.” But now every few minutes people carried a casket into the 
church, left, “and there would be another casket.” Each time the bells 
rang.“The bells were my joy and then this ‘BONG! BONG! BONG!’ I was 
terriﬁed, lying sick in bed hearing ‘BONG! BONG! BONG!’ Is the bell 
going to bong for me?” 
The war was over there. The epidemic was here. The war ended. The 
epidemic continued. Fear settled over the nation like a frozen blanket. 
“Some say the world will end in ﬁre,” wrote Robert Frost in 1920. “Ice is 
also great / and would sufﬁce.” 
An internal American Red Cross report concluded, “A fear and panic 
of the inﬂuenza, akin to the terror of the Middle Ages regarding the Black 
Plague, [has] been prevalent in many parts of the country.” 
"
"C H A P T E R  T H I R T Y

ires poured into the Red Cross and the Public Health Service 
demanding, pleading, begging for help. From Portsmouth, Vir-
ginia: “Urgently need two colored physicians wire prospects obtaining 
same.” From Carey, Kentucky: “Federal coal mines request immediate aid 
inﬂuenza. . . . Immediately rush answer.” From Spokane, Washington; 
“urgent need of four nurses to take charge other nurses furnished by local 
Red Cross chapter.” 
The demands could not be met. Replies went back: “No colored 
physicians available.” “It is almost impossible to send nurses all being 
needed locally.” “Call for local volunteers with intelligence and practical 
experience.” 
The failure to meet demand was not from lack of trying. Red Cross 
workers went from house to house searching for anyone with nursing 
experience. And when they knew of a skilled nurse, the Red Cross tracked 
her down. Josey Brown was a nurse watching a movie in a St. Louis the-
ater when the lights went on, the screen went blank, and a man appeared 
onstage announcing that anyone named Josey Brown should go to the 
ticket booth. There she found a telegram ordering her to the Great Lakes 
Naval Training Station. 
The Journal of the American Medical Association repeatedly— 
sometimes twice in the same issue—published an “urgent call on physi-
cians for help in localities where the epidemic is unusually severe. . . .  
"
"352 
The Great Influenza 
This service is just as deﬁnite a patriotic privilege as is that of serving in 
the Medical Corps of the Army or Navy. . . . As  the call is immediate and 
urgent it is suggested that any physician who feels that he can do some of 
this work telegraph to the Surgeon General, USPHS, Washington, D.C.” 
There were never enough. 
Meanwhile, physicians attempted everything—everything—to save 
lives. They could relieve some symptoms. Doctors could address pain 
with everything from aspirin to morphine. They could control coughing 
at least somewhat with codeine and, said some, heroin. They gave 
atropine, digitalis, strychnine, and epinephrine as stimulants. They gave 
oxygen. 
Some treatment attempts that went beyond symptomatic relief had 
solid science behind them, even if no one had ever applied that science to 
inﬂuenza. There was Redden’s approach in Boston based on Lewis’s 
experiments with polio. That approach, with variations, was tried over 
and over again around the world. 
And there were treatments less grounded in science. They sounded 
logical. They were logical. But the reasoning was also desperate, the rea-
soning of a doctor ready to try anything, the reasoning that mixed wild 
ideas or thousands of years of practice and a few decades of scientiﬁc 
method. First-rate medical journals rejected articles about the most out-
landish and ridiculous so-called therapies, but they published anything 
that at least seemed to make sense. There was no time for peer review, no 
time for careful analysis. 
JAMA published the work of a physician who claimed, “Infection was 
prevented in practically 100% of cases when [my] treatment was prop-
erly used.” His approach had logic to it. By stimulating the ﬂow of mucus, 
he hoped to help one of the ﬁrst lines of defense of the body, to prevent 
any pathogen from attaching itself to any mucosal membrane. So he 
mixed irritating chemicals in powder form and blew them into the upper 
respiratory tract to generate large ﬂows of mucus. The theory was sound; 
perhaps while mucus was actually ﬂowing, it did some good. 
One Philadelphia doctor had another idea, logical but more reaching, 
and wrote in JAMA that “when the system is saturated with alkalis, there 
is poor soil for bacterial growth.” Therefore he tried to turn the entire 
body alkaline. “I have uniformly employed, and always with good results, 
potassium citrate and sodium bicarbonate saturation by mouth, bowel

and skin. . . . Patients must be willing to forego [sic] the seductive relief 
by acetylsalicylic acid [aspirin]. . . . My very successful experience in this 
epidemic cannot be dismissed as accidental or unique. . . . I  urge its 
immediate trial empirically. Further investigation in laboratory or clinic 
may follow later.” 
Physicians injected people with typhoid vaccine, thinking—or simply 
hoping—it might somehow boost the immune system in general even 
though the speciﬁcity of the immune response was well understood. 
Some claimed the treatment worked. Others poured every known vac-
cine into patients on the same theory. Quinine worked on one disease: 
malaria. Many physicians gave it for inﬂuenza with no better reasoning 
than desperation. 
Others convinced themselves a treatment cured regardless of results. 
A Montana physician reported to the New York Medical Journal of his 
experimental treatment; “The results have been favorable.” He tried the 
treatment on six people; two died. Still he insisted, “In the four cases that 
recovered the results were immediate and certain.” 
Two University of Pittsburgh researchers reasoned no better. They be-
lieved they had improved on the technique Redden had adopted from 
Flexner and Lewis. They treated forty-seven patients; twenty died. They 
subtracted seven deaths, arguing that the victims received the therapy 
too late. That still left thirteen dead out of forty-seven. Yet they claimed 
success. 
One physician gave hydrogen peroxide intravenously to twenty-ﬁve 
patients in severe pulmonary distress, believing that it would get oxygen 
into the blood. Thirteen recovered; twelve died. This physician, too, 
claimed success: “The anoxemia was often markedly beneﬁted, and the 
toxemia appeared to be overcome in many cases.” 
Many of his colleagues tried similarly outlandish treatments and like-
wise claimed success. Many of them believed it. 
Homeopaths believed that the epidemic proved their superiority to 
“allopathic” physicians. The Journal of the American Institute for Home-
opathy claimed that inﬂuenza victims treated by regular physicians had a 
mortality rate of 28.2 percent—an absurdity: if that were so, the United 
States alone would have had several million deaths—while also claiming 
that twenty-six thousand patients treated by homeopaths, chieﬂy with 
the herbal drug gelsemium, had a mortality rate of 1.05 percent, with 
"
"354 
The Great Influenza 
many homeopaths claiming no deaths whatsoever among thousands of 
patients. But the results were self-reported, making it far too easy to ration-
alize away those under their care who did die—to remove, for instance, 
from their sample any patient who, against their advice, took aspirin, 
which homeopaths considered a poison. 
It was no different elsewhere in the world. In Greece one physician used 
mustard plasters to create blisters on the skin of inﬂuenza victims, then 
drained them, mixed the ﬂuid with morphine, strychnine, and caffeine 
and reinjected it. “The effect was apparent at once, and in 36 to 48 or even 
12 hours the temperature declined and improvement progressed.” But 
the mortality rate of his 234 patients was 6 percent. 
It Italy one doctor gave intravenous injections of mercuric chloride. 
Another rubbed creosote, a disinfectant, into the axilla, where lymph nodes, 
outposts of white blood cells scattered through the body, lie beneath the 
skin. A third insisted that enemas of warm milk and one drop of creosote 
every twelve hours for every year of age prevented pneumonia. 
In Britain the War Ofﬁce published recommendations for therapy in 
The Lancet. They were far more speciﬁc than any guidance in the United 
States, and likely did relieve some symptoms. For sleep, twenty grains of 
bromide, opiates to relax cough, and oxygen for cyanosis. The recom-
mendations warned that venesection was seldom beneﬁcial, that alcohol 
was invaluable, but that little could be gained by giving food. For head-
ache: antipyrin and salicylic acid—aspirin. To stimulate the heart: strych-
nine and digitalis. 
In France, not until mid-October did the Ministry of War approach 
the Académie des Sciences for help. To prevent disease, some physicians 
and scientists advised masks. Others insisted arsenic prevented it. For 
treatment, the Pasteur Institute developed an antipneumococcus serum 
drawn as usual from horses, as well as a serum derived from the blood of 
patients who had recovered. (Comparisons proved the Cole and Avery 
serum far superior.) Anything that might lower fever was urged. Stimu-
lants were recommended for the heart. So were “revulsions” that purged 
the body. Methylene blue, a dye used to stain bacteria to make them more 
visible under the microscope, was tried despite its known toxicity in the 
hopes of killing bacteria. Other doctors injected metallic solutions into 
"

The Tolling of the Bell 
muscle, so the body absorbed them gradually, or intravenously. (One 
doctor who injected it intravenously conceded that the treatment was “a 
little brutal.”) Cupping was recommended—using a ﬂame to absorb oxy-
gen and thus create a vacuum in a glass container, then placing it on the 
body, in theory to draw out poisons. One prominent physician called for 
“prompt bleeding” of more than pint of blood at the ﬁrst signs of pul-
monary edema and cyanosis, along with acetylsalicylic acid. He was hardly 
alone in prescribing bleeding. One physician who recommended a return 
to “heroic medicine” explained that the more the doctor did, the more 
the body was stimulated to respond. In disease as in war, he said, the 
ﬁghter must seize initiative. 
Across the world hundreds of millions—very likely tens of millions in the 
United States alone—saw no doctor, saw no nurse, but tried every kind of 
folk medicine or fraudulent remedy available or imaginable. Camphor 
balls and garlic hung around people’s necks. Others gargled with disin-
fectants, let frigid air sweep through their homes, or sealed windows shut 
and overheated rooms. 
Advertisements ﬁlled the newspapers, sometimes set in the same 
small type as—and difﬁcult to distinguish from—news articles, and 
sometimes set in large fonts blaring across a page. The one thing they 
shared: they all declared with conﬁdence there was a way to stop inﬂuenza, 
there was a way to survive. Some claims were as simple as a shoe store’s 
advertising, “One way to keep the ﬂu away is to keep your feet dry.” Some 
were as complex as “Making a Kolynos Gas Mask To Fight Spanish 
Inﬂuenza When Exposed to Infection.” 
They also all played to fear. “How To Prevent Infection From Spanish 
Inﬂuenza. . . .  The Surgeon General of the U.S. Army urges you to keep 
your mouth clean. . . .  [use] a few drops of liquid SOZODONT.”“Help your 
Health Board Conquer Spanish inﬂuenza By Disinfecting your Home . . .  
Lysol Disinfectant.” “For GRIP . . . You are Safe  When  You Take Father 
John’s Medicine.” “Inﬂu-BALM Prevents Spanish Flu.” “Special Notice to 
the Public. Telephone inquiries from Minneapolis physicians and the 
laity and letters from many parts of America are coming into our ofﬁce 
regarding the use of Benetol, . . . a powerful bulwark for the prevention 
and treatment of Spanish inﬂuenza. . . .”  “Spanish inﬂuenza—what it is

and how it should be treated: . . . Always Call a Doctor/ No Occasion For 
Panic. . . . There is no occasion for panic—inﬂuenza itself has a very low 
percentage of fatalities. . . . Use Vicks VapoRub.” 
By the middle of October, vaccines prepared by the best scientists were 
appearing everywhere. On October 17 New York City Health Commis-
sioner Royal Copeland announced that “the inﬂuenza vaccine discovered by 
Dr. William H. Park, director of the City Laboratories, had been tested suf-
ﬁciently to warrant its recommendation as a preventive agency.” Copeland 
assured the public that “virtually all persons vaccinated with it [were] 
immune to the disease.” 
In Philadelphia on October 19, Dr. C. Y. White, a bacteriologist with 
the municipal laboratory, delivered ten thousand dosages of a vaccine 
based on Paul Lewis’s work, with tens of thousands of dosages more soon 
to come. It was “multivalent,” made up of dead strains of several kinds of 
bacteria, including the inﬂuenza bacillus, two types of pneumococci, and 
several strains of other streptococci. 
That same day a new issue of JAMA appeared. It was thick with infor-
mation on inﬂuenza, including a preliminary evaluation of the experience 
with vaccines in Boston. George Whipple, another Welch product and 
later a Nobel laureate, concluded,“The weight of such statistical evidence 
as we have been able to accumulate indicates that the use of the inﬂuenza 
vaccine which we have investigated is without therapeutic beneﬁt.” By 
“therapeutic” Whipple meant that the tested vaccines could not cure. But 
he continued, “The statistical evidence, so far as it goes, indicates a prob-
ability that the use of this vaccine has some prophylactic value.” 
He was hardly endorsing Copeland’s statement, but at least he pro-
vided some hope. 
The Public Health Service made no effort to produce or distribute any 
vaccine or treatment for civilians. It received requests enough. It had 
nothing to offer. 
The Army Medical School (now the Armed Forces Institute of Pathol-
ogy) in Washington did mount a massive effort to make a vaccine. They 
needed one. At the army’s own Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, the 
death rate for those with complicating pneumonia had reached 52 per-
cent. On October 25 the vaccine was ready. The surgeon general’s ofﬁce 
informed all camp physicians, “The value of vaccination against certain 
"
"357 
The Tolling of the Bell 
of the more important organisms giving rise to pneumonia may be con-
sidered to be established. . . .  The Army now has available for all ofﬁcers, 
enlisted men, and civilian employees of the Army, a lipo vaccine contain-
ing pneumococcus Types I, II, and III.” 
The army distributed two million doses of this vaccine in the next 
weeks. This marked an enormous production triumph. Earlier a promi-
nent British scientist had pronounced it impossible for the British gov-
ernment to produce even forty thousand doses on short notice. But the 
vaccine still protected only against pneumonias caused by Types I and II 
pneumococci, and it came too late; by then the disease had already passed 
through nearly all cantonments. When civilian physicians from New York 
to California begged for the vaccine from the army, the reply came back 
that the army had in fact produced “a vaccine for the prevention of pneu-
monia, but none is available for distribution.” The army feared a recrude-
scence among troops; it had good reason to fear one. 
The Army Medical School had also produced a vaccine against B. in-
ﬂuenzae, but of this Gorgas’s ofﬁce spoke more cautiously: “In view of the 
possible etiologic importance of the bacillus inﬂuenzae in the present 
epidemic, a saline vaccine has been prepared by the Army and is available 
to all ofﬁcers, enlisted men, and civilian employees of the Army. The effec-
tiveness of bacillus inﬂuenzae vaccine . . . is still in  the experimental stage.” 
That army statement was not a public one. Nor really was a caution-
ary JAMA editorial: “Unfortunately we as yet have no speciﬁc serum or 
other speciﬁc means for the cure of inﬂuenza, and no speciﬁc vaccine for 
its prevention. Such is the fact, all claims and propagandists in the news-
papers and elsewhere to the contrary notwithstanding. . . . Consequently 
the physician must keep his head and not allow himself to make more 
promises than the facts warrant. This warning applies especially to health 
ofﬁcers in their public relations.” Nearly every issue contained a similar 
warning: “Nothing should be done by the medical profession that may 
arouse unwarranted hope among the public and be followed by disap-
pointment and distrust of medical science and the medical profession.” 
JAMA represented the American Medical Association. AMA leaders 
had worked for decades to bring scientiﬁc standards and professionalism 
to medicine. They had only recently succeeded. They did not want to 
destroy the trust only recently established. They did not want medicine to 
become the mockery it had been not so long before. 
"
"358 
The Great Influenza 
In the meantime physicians continued to try the most desperate  mea-
sures. Vaccines continued to be produced in great numbers—eighteen 
different kinds in Illinois alone. No one had any real idea whether any 
would work. They had only hope. 
But the reality of the disease was expressed in a recitation of events 
during the epidemic at Camp Sherman, Ohio, the single camp with the 
highest death rate. Its doctors precisely followed the standard treatment 
for inﬂuenza Osler had recommended in the most recent edition of his 
textbook—aspirin, rest in bed, gargles, and “Dover’s powders,” which 
were a combination of ipecac to induce vomiting and opium to relieve 
pain and cough. For complicating but standard pneumonias they fol-
lowed “the usual recommendations for diet, fresh air, rest, mild purga-
tion and elimination. . . . All  cases were digitalized”—digitalis given in 
maximum possible dosages to stimulate the heart—“and reliance placed 
on soluble caffeine salt for quick stimulation. Strychnin in large doses 
hypodermically had a distinct value in the existing asthenia.” 
Then, however, they reported their helplessness in the far too common 
“acute inﬂammatory pulmonary edema,” what today would be called 
ARDS.“This presented a new problem in therapy. The principles of treat-
ment employed in pulmonary edema incident to dilation of the heart, 
though seemingly not indicated by the condition in question, were em-
ployed. Digitalis, a double caffeine salt, morphin [sic], and venesection”— 
bleeding again—“were without signiﬁcant value. . . . Oxygen was of 
temporary value. Posture accomplished drainage but did not inﬂuence 
the end result. Pituitary solution, hypodermically, was suggested by the 
similarity of this condition to the results of gassing. No beneﬁts were 
gained by its use.” 
They tried everything, everything they could think of, until they 
ﬁnally took pity and stopped, abandoning some of the more brutal—and 
useless—treatments they had tried “on account of [their] heroic charac-
ter.” By then they had seen enough of heroism from dying soldiers. They 
were ﬁnally willing to let them go in peace. Against this condition they 
could only conclude, “No especial measure was of avail.” 
No medicine and none of the vaccines developed then could prevent 
inﬂuenza. The masks worn by millions were useless as designed and could 
"
"359 
The Tolling of the Bell 
not prevent inﬂuenza. Only preventing exposure to the virus could. Noth-
ing today can cure inﬂuenza, although vaccines can provide signiﬁcant— 
but nowhere near complete—protection, and several antiviral drugs can 
mitigate its severity. 
Places that isolated themselves—such as Gunnison, Colorado, and a 
few military installations on islands—escaped. But the closing orders 
that most cities issued could not prevent exposure; they were not extreme 
enough. Closing saloons and theaters and churches meant nothing if sig-
niﬁcant numbers of people continued to climb onto streetcars, contin-
ued to go to work, continued to go to the grocer. Even where fear closed 
down businesses, where both store owners and customers refused to 
stand face-to-face and left orders on sidewalks, there was still too much 
interaction to break the chain of infection. The virus was too efﬁcient, 
too explosive, too good at what it did. In the end the virus did its will 
around the world. 
It was as if the virus were a hunter. It was hunting mankind. It found 
man in the cities easily, but it was not satisﬁed. It followed him into 
towns, then villages, then individual homes. It searched for him in the 
most distant corners of the earth. It hunted him in the forests, tracked 
him into jungles, pursued him onto the ice. And in those most distant 
corners of the earth, in those places so inhospitable that they barely 
allowed man to live, in those places where man was almost wholly inno-
cent of civilization, man was not safer from the virus. He was more vul-
nerable. 
In Alaska, whites in Fairbanks protected themselves. Sentries guarded 
all trails, and every person entering the city was quarantined for ﬁve days. 
Eskimos had no such luck. A senior Red Cross ofﬁcial warned that with-
out “immediate medical assistance the race” could become “extinct.” 
Neither Red Cross nor territorial government funds were available. The 
governor of Alaska came to Washington to beg Congress for $200,000— 
compared to the $1 million given to the Public Health Service for the 
entire country. A senator asked why the territory couldn’t spend any of 
the $600,000 in its treasury. The governor replied, “The people of Alaska 
consider that the money raised by taxes from the white people of Alaska 
should be spent for the improvements of the Territory. They need the 
money in roads a great deal. . . . They  want to have the Indians in Alaska

The Great Influenza 
placed more on a parity with the Indians of other parts of the United 
States, where they are taken care of by the United States government.” 
He got $100,000. The navy provided the collier USS Brutus to carry a 
relief expedition. At Juneau the party divided and went in smaller boats 
to visit villages. 
They found terrible things. Terrible things. In Nome, 176 of 300 Eski-
mos had died. But it would get worse. One doctor visited ten tiny villages 
and found “three wiped out entirely; others average 85% deaths. . . . Sur-
vivors generally children . . . probably 25% this number frozen to death 
before help arrived.” 
A later relief expedition followed, funded by the Red Cross, dividing 
itself in the Aleutian Islands into six groups of two doctors and two 
nurses each, then boarding other ships and dispersing. 
The ﬁrst group disembarked at a ﬁshing village called Micknick. They 
arrived too late. Only half a dozen adults survived. Thirty-eight adults 
and twelve children had died. A small house had been turned into an 
orphanage for ﬁfteen children. The group crossed the Naknek River to a 
village with a seafood cannery. Twenty-four adult Eskimos had lived 
there before the epidemic. Twenty-two had died; a twenty-third death 
occurred the day after the relief expedition arrived. Sixteen children, now 
orphans, survived. On Nushagak Bay the Peterson Packing Company had 
established a headquarters and warehouse. Nurses went hut to hut. “The 
epidemic of inﬂuenza had been most severe at this place, few adults liv-
ing. On making a search Drs. Healy and Reiley found a few natives bed-
fast. . . .  The doctors worked most faithfully but help arrived too late and 
ﬁve of the patients died.” 
There was worse. Another rescue team reported, “Numerous villages 
were found but no sign of life about except for packs of half-starved, semi-
wild dogs.” The Eskimos there lived in what was called a “barabara.” 
Barabaras were circular structures two-thirds underground; they were 
built like that to withstand the shrieking winds that routinely blew at 
hurricane force, winds that ripped conventional structures apart. One 
rescuer described a barabara as “roughed over with slabs of peat sod, . . .  
entrance to which is gained through a tunnel of from four to ﬁve feet in 
height, this tunnel being its only means of light and ventilation, in most 
cases; about the sides of these rooms are dug shelves and in these shelves, 
on mattresses of dried grasses and furs, the people sleep.” 
"
"361 
The Tolling of the Bell 
Entire family groups, a dozen people or more, lived in this one room. 
“On entering these barabaras, Dr. McGillicuddy’s party found heaps of 
dead bodies on the shelves and ﬂoors, men, women, and children and the 
majority of the cases too far decomposed to be handled.” 
The virus probably did not kill all of them directly. But it struck so 
suddenly, with such simultaneity, it left no one well enough to care for 
any others, no one to get food, no one to get water. And those who could 
have survived, surrounded by bodies, bodies of people they loved, might 
well have preferred to go where their family had gone, might well have 
wanted to no longer be alone. 
And then the dogs would have come. 
“It was quite impossible to estimate the number of dead as the starving 
dogs had dug their way into many huts and devoured the dead, a few 
bones and clothing left to tell the story.” 
All the relief party could do was tie ropes around remains, drag them 
outside, and bury them. 
On the opposite edge of the continent the story was the same. In Labrador 
man clung to existence with tenacity but not much more permanency 
than seaweed drying on a rock, vulnerable to the crash of surf at high 
tide. The Reverend Henry Gordon left the village of Cartwright in late 
October and returned a few days later, on October 30. He found “not a 
soul to be seen anywhere, and a strange, unusual silence.” Heading home, 
he met a Hudson’s Bay Company man who told him “sickness . . . has  
struck the place like a cyclone, two days after the Mail boat had left.” Gor-
don went from house to house. “Whole households lay inanimate on 
their kitchen ﬂoors, unable even to feed themselves or look after the ﬁre.” 
Twenty-six of one hundred souls had died. Farther up the coast, it was 
worse. 
Of 220 people at Hebron, 150 died. The weather was already bitter 
cold. The dead lay in their beds, sweat having frozen their bedclothes to 
them. Gordon and some others from Cartwright made no effort to dig 
graves, consigning the bodies to the sea. He wrote, “A feeling of intense 
resentment at the callousness of the authorities, who sent us the disease 
by mail-boat, and then left us to sink or swim, ﬁlled one’s heart almost to 
the exclusion of all else. . . .” 
Then there was Okak. Two hundred sixty-six people had lived in 
"
"362 
The Great Influenza 
Okak, and many dogs, dogs nearly wild. When the virus came it struck so 
hard so fast people could not care for themselves or feed the dogs. The 
dogs grew hungry, crazed with hunger, devoured each other, and then 
wildly smashed through windows and doors, and fed. The Reverend 
Andrew Asboe survived with his riﬂe beside him; he personally killed 
over one hundred dogs. 
When the Reverend Walter Perret arrived, only ﬁfty-nine people out 
of 266 still lived. He and the survivors did the only work there was. 
“The ground was frozen hard as iron, and the work of digging was as 
hard as ever work was. It took about two weeks to do it, and when it 
was ﬁnished it was 32 feet long, 10 feet wide, and eight feet deep.” Now 
began the task of dragging the corpses to the pit. They laid 114 bodies in 
the pit, each wrapped in calico, sprinkled disinfectants over them, and 
covered the trench, placing rocks on top to prevent the dogs from tearing 
it up. 
In all of Labrador, at least one-third the total population died. 
The virus pierced the ice of the Arctic and climbed the roadless moun-
tains of Kentucky. It also penetrated the jungle. 
Among Westerners the heaviest blows fell upon young adults densely 
packed together, civilian or military. Metropolitan Life Insurance found 
that 6.21 percent of all coal miners—not just those with inﬂuenza— 
whom it insured between the ages of twenty-ﬁve and forty-ﬁve died; in 
that same age group, 3.26 percent of all industrial workers it insured 
died—comparable to the worst rates in the army camps. 
In Frankfurt the mortality rate of all those hospitalized with inﬂuenza— 
not all those with pneumonia—was 27.3 percent. In Cologne the mayor, 
Konrad Adenauer, who would become one of Europe’s great statesmen, 
said the disease left thousands “too exhausted to hate.” 
In Paris the government closed only schools, fearing that anything 
else would hurt morale. The death rate there was 10 percent of inﬂuenza 
victims and 50 percent of those who developed any complications. 
“These cases,” noted one French physician, “were remarkable for the 
severity of the symptoms and the rapidity with which certain forms pro-
gressed to death.” Although the symptoms in France were typical of the 
disease elsewhere, deep into the epidemic physicians seemed to pur-
posely misdiagnose it as cholera or dysentery and rarely reported it. 
"
"363 
The Tolling of the Bell 
And populations whose immune systems were naive, whose immune 
systems had seen few if any inﬂuenza viruses of any kind, were not just 
decimated but sometimes annihilated. This was true not only of Eskimos 
but of all Native Americans, of Paciﬁc Islanders, of Africans. 
In Gambia, 8 percent of the Europeans would die, but from the inte-
rior one British visitor reported, “I found whole villages of 300 to 400 
families completely wiped out, the houses having fallen in on the unburied 
dead, and the jungle having crept in within two months, obliterating 
whole settlements.” 
Even when the virus mutated toward mildness, it still killed efﬁciently 
in those whose immune systems had rarely or never been exposed to 
inﬂuenza. The USS Logan reached Guam on October 26. Nearly 95 per-
cent of American sailors ashore caught the disease, but only a single sailor 
died. The same virus killed almost 5 percent of the entire native popula-
tion in a few weeks. 
In Cape Town and several other cities in South Africa, inﬂuenza 
would kill 4 percent of the entire population within four weeks of the 
ﬁrst reported cases. Thirty-two percent of white South Africans and 
46 percent of the blacks would be attacked; 0.82 percent of white Euro-
peans would die, along with at least 2.72 percent—likely a far, far higher 
percentage—of black Africans. 
In Mexico the virus swarmed through the dense population centers 
and through the jungles, overwhelming occupants of mining camps, slum 
dwellers and slum landlords, and rural peasants alike. In the state of Chi-
apas, 10 percent of the entire population—not 10 percent of those with 
inﬂuenza—would die. 
The virus ripped through Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, and Switzer-
land, leaving each devastated and keening with a death toll that in some 
areas exceeded 10 percent of the overall population. 
In Brazil—where the virus was relatively mild, at least compared with 
Mexico or for that matter Chile—Rio de Janeiro suffered an attack rate of 
33 percent. 
In Buenos Aires, Argentina, the virus attacked nearly 55 percent of the 
population. 
In Japan it attacked more than one-third of the population. 
The virus would kill 7 percent of the entire population in much of 
Russia and Iran. 
"
"364 
The Great Influenza 
In Guam, 10 percent of the population would die. 
Elsewhere the mortality exceeded even that. In the Fiji Islands, 14 per-
cent of the population would die in the sixteen days between November 25 
and December 10. It was impossible to bury the dead. Wrote one observer, 
“day and night trucks rumbled through the streets, ﬁlled with bodies for 
the constantly burning pyres.” 
A very few—very few—isolated locations around the world, where it 
was possible to impose a rigid quarantine and where authorities did so 
ruthlessly, escaped the disease entirely. American Samoa was one such 
place. There not a single person died of inﬂuenza. 
Across a few miles of ocean lay Western Samoa, seized from Germany 
by New Zealand at the start of war. On September 30, 1918, its popula-
tion was 38,302, before the steamer Talune brought the disease to the 
island. A few months later, the population was 29,802. Twenty-two percent 
of the population died. 
Huge but unknown numbers died in China. In Chungking one-half 
the population of the city was ill. 
And yet the most terrifying numbers would come from India. As else-
where, India had suffered a spring wave. As elsewhere, this spring wave 
was relatively benign. In September inﬂuenza returned to Bombay. As 
elsewhere, it was no longer benign. 
Yet India was not like elsewhere. There inﬂuenza would take on truly 
killing dimensions. A serious epidemic of bubonic plague had struck 
there in 1900, and it had struck Bombay especially hard. In 1918 the peak 
daily inﬂuenza mortality in Bombay almost doubled that of the 1900 
bubonic plague, and the case mortality rate for inﬂuenza reached 10.3 
percent. 
Throughout the Indian subcontinent, there was only death. Trains left 
one station with the living. They arrived with the dead and dying, the 
corpses removed as the trains pulled into station. British troops, Cau-
casians, in India suffered a case mortality rate of 9.61 percent. For Indian 
troops, 21.69 percent of those who caught inﬂuenza died. One hospital in 
Delhi treated 13,190 inﬂuenza patients; 7,044 of those patients died. 
The most devastated region was the Punjab. One physician reported 
that hospitals were so “choked that it was impossible to remove the dead 
quickly enough to make room for the dying. The streets and lanes of the 
"

The Tolling of the Bell 
city were littered with dead and dying people. . . . Nearly every  house-
hold was lamenting a death and everywhere terror reigned.” 
Normally corpses there were cremated in burning ghats, level spaces 
at the top of the stepped riverbank, and the ashes given to the river. The 
supply of ﬁrewood was quickly exhausted, making cremation impossible, 
and the rivers became clogged with corpses. 
In the Indian subcontinent alone, it is likely that close to twenty mil-
lion died, and quite possibly the death toll exceeded that number. 
Victor Vaughan, Welch’s old ally, sitting in the ofﬁce of the surgeon 
general of the army and head of the army’s Division of Communicable 
Diseases, watched the virus move across the earth. “If the epidemic con-
tinues its mathematical rate of acceleration, civilization could easily,” he 
wrote in hand, “disappear . . . from  the face of the earth within a matter 
of a few more weeks.”

aughan believed that the inﬂuenza virus came close to threaten-
ing the existence of civilization. In fact, some diseases depend upon 
civilization for their own existence. Measles is one example. Since a single 
exposure to measles usually gives lifetime immunity, the measles virus 
cannot ﬁnd enough susceptible individuals in small towns to survive; 
without a new human generation to infect, the virus dies out. Epidemiol-
ogists have computed that measles requires an unvaccinated population 
of at least half a million people living in fairly close contact to continue 
to exist. 
The inﬂuenza virus is different. Since birds provide a natural home 
for it, inﬂuenza does not depend upon civilization. In terms of its own 
survival, it did not matter if humans existed or not. 
Twenty years before the great inﬂuenza pandemic, H. G. Wells published 
War of the Worlds, a novel in which Martians invaded the earth. They 
loosed upon the world their death ships, and they were indomitable. 
They began to feed upon humans, sucking the life force from them down 
to the marrow of the bone. Man, for all his triumphs of the nineteenth 
century, a century in which his achievements had reordered the world, 
had become suddenly impotent. No force known to mankind, no tech-
nology or strategy or effort or heroism that any nation or person on earth 
had developed, could stand against the invaders. 
"
"370 
The Great Influenza 
Wells wrote, “I felt the ﬁrst inkling of a thing that presently grew quite 
clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethrone-
ment, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among 
the animals. . . .  The fear and empire of man had passed away.” 
But just as the destruction of the human race seemed inevitable, 
nature intervened. The invaders were themselves invaded; the earth’s 
infectious pathogens killed them. Natural processes had done what sci-
ence could not. 
With the inﬂuenza virus, natural processes began to work as well. 
At ﬁrst those processes had made the virus more lethal. Whether it 
ﬁrst jumped from an animal host to man in Kansas or in some other 
place, as it passed from person to person it adapted to its new host, 
became increasingly efﬁcient in its ability to infect, and changed from the 
virus that caused a generally mild ﬁrst wave of disease in the spring of 
1918 to the lethal and explosive killer of the second wave in the fall. 
But once this happened, once it achieved near-maximum efﬁciency, 
two other natural processes came into play. 
One process involved immunity. Once the virus passed through a 
population, that population developed at least some immunity to it. Vic-
tims were not likely to be reinfected by the same virus, not until it had 
undergone antigen drift. In a city or town, the cycle from ﬁrst case to the 
end of a local epidemic in 1918 generally ran six to eight weeks. In the 
army camps, with the men packed so densely, the cycle took usually three 
to four weeks. 
Individual cases continued to occur after that, but the explosion of 
disease ended, and it ended abruptly. A graph of cases would look like a 
bell curve—but one chopped off almost like a cliff just after the peak, 
with new cases suddenly dropping to next to nothing. In Philadelphia, for 
example, in the week ending October 16 the disease killed 4,597 people. 
It was ripping the city apart, emptying the streets, sparking rumors of the 
Black Death. But new cases dropped so precipitously that only ten days 
later, on October 26, the order closing public places was lifted. By the 
armistice on November 11, inﬂuenza had almost entirely disappeared 
from that city. The virus burned through available fuel. Then it quickly 
faded away. 
The second process occurred within the virus. It was only inﬂuenza. 
By nature the inﬂuenza virus is dangerous, considerably more dangerous

than the common aches and fever lead people to believe, but it does not 
kill routinely as it did in 1918. The 1918 pandemic reached an extreme 
of virulence unknown in any other widespread inﬂuenza outbreak in 
history. 
But the 1918 virus, like all inﬂuenza viruses, like all viruses that form 
mutant swarms, mutated rapidly. There is a mathematical concept called 
“reversion to the mean”; this states simply that an extreme event is likely 
to be followed by a less extreme event. This is not a law, only a probabil-
ity. The 1918 virus stood at an extreme; any mutations were more likely 
to make it less lethal than more lethal. In general, that is what happened. 
So just as it seemed that the virus would bring civilization to its knees, 
would do what the plagues of the Middle Ages had done, would remake 
the world, the virus mutated toward its mean, toward the behavior of 
most inﬂuenza viruses. As time went on, it became less lethal. 
This ﬁrst became apparent in army cantonments in the United States. 
Of the army’s twenty largest cantonments, the ﬁrst ﬁve attacked saw 
roughly 20 percent of all soldiers who caught inﬂuenza develop pneumo-
nia. And 37.3 percent of the soldiers who developed pneumonia died. 
The worst numbers came from Camp Sherman in Ohio, which suffered 
the highest percentage of soldiers killed and was one of the ﬁrst camps 
hit: 35.7 percent of inﬂuenza cases at Sherman developed pneumonia. 
And 61.3 percent of those pneumonia victims died. Sherman doctors 
carried a stigma for this, and the army investigated but found them as 
competent as elsewhere. They did all that was being done elsewhere. They 
were simply struck by a particularly lethal strain of the virus. 
In the last ﬁve camps attacked, hit on average three weeks later, only 
7.1 percent of inﬂuenza victims developed pneumonia. And only 17.8 
percent of the soldiers who developed pneumonia died. 
One alternative explanation to this improvement is that army doctors 
simply got better at preventing and treating pneumonia. But people of 
scientiﬁc and epidemiological accomplishment looked hard for any evi-
dence of that. They found none. The army’s chief investigator was George 
Soper, later handpicked by Welch to oversee the nation’s ﬁrst effort to 
coordinate a comprehensive program of cancer research. Soper reviewed 
all written reports and interviewed many medical ofﬁcers. He concluded 
that the only effective measure used against inﬂuenza in any of the camps 
had been to isolate both individual inﬂuenza victims and, if necessary, 
"
"372 
The Great Influenza 
entire commands that became infected: these efforts “failed when and 
where they were carelessly applied” but “did some good. . . . when and  
where they were rigidly carried out.” He found no evidence that anything 
else worked, that anything else affected the course of the disease, that 
anything else changed except the virus itself. The later the disease 
attacked, the less vicious the blow. 
Inside each camp the same thing held true. Soldiers struck down in 
the ﬁrst ten days or two weeks died at much higher rates than soldiers in 
the same camp struck down late in the epidemic or after the epidemic 
actually ended. 
Similarly, the ﬁrst cities invaded by the virus—Boston, Baltimore, 
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Louisville, New York, New Orleans, and smaller 
cities hit at the same time—all suffered grievously. And in those same 
places, the people infected later in the epidemic were not becoming as ill, 
were not dying at the same rate, as those infected in the ﬁrst two to three 
weeks. 
Cities struck later in the epidemic also usually had lower mortality 
rates. In one of the most careful epidemiological studies of the epidemic 
in one state, the investigator noted that, in Connecticut, “one factor that 
appeared to affect the mortality rate was proximity in time to the original 
outbreak at New London, the point at which the disease was ﬁrst intro-
duced  into  Connecticut. . . .  The virus was most virulent or most readily 
communicable when it ﬁrst reached the state, and thereafter became gen-
erally attenuated.” 
The same pattern held true throughout the country and, for that mat-
ter, the world. It was not a rigid predictor. The virus was never completely 
consistent. But places hit later tended to be hit more easily. San Antonio 
suffered one of the highest attack rates but lowest death rates in the coun-
try; the virus there infected 53.5 percent of the population, and 98 per-
cent of all homes in the city had at least one person sick with inﬂuenza. 
But there the virus had mutated toward mildness; only 0.8 percent of 
those who got inﬂuenza died. (This death rate was still double that of 
normal inﬂuenza.) The virus itself, more than any treatment provided, 
determined who lived and who died. 
A decade after the pandemic, a careful and comprehensive scientiﬁc 
review of ﬁndings and statistics not only in the United States but around 
the world conﬁrmed, “In the later stages of the epidemic the supposedly 
"

characteristic inﬂuenza lesions were less frequently found, the share of 
secondary invaders was more plainly recognizable, and the differences of 
locality were sharply marked. . . .  [I]n 1919 the ‘water-logged’ lungs”— 
those in which death came quickly from ARDS—“were relatively rarely 
encountered.” 
Despite aberrations, then, in general in youth the virus was violent 
and lethal; in maturity it mellowed. The later the epidemic struck a local-
ity, and the later within that local epidemic someone got sick, the less 
lethal the inﬂuenza. The correlations are not perfect. Louisville suffered a 
violent attack in both spring and fall. The virus was unstable and always 
different. But a correlation does exist between the timing of the outbreak 
in a region and lethality. Even as the virus mellowed it still killed. It still 
killed often enough that in maturity it would have been, except for its 
own younger self, the most lethal inﬂuenza virus ever known. But timing 
mattered. 
The East and South, hit earliest, were hit the hardest. The West Coast 
was hit less hard. And the middle of the country suffered the least. In 
Seattle, in Portland, in Los Angeles, in San Diego, the dead did not pile up 
as in the East. In St. Louis, in Chicago, in Indianapolis, the dead did not 
pile up as in the West. But if the dead did not pile up there as they had in 
Philadelphia and New Orleans, they did still pile up. 
By late November, with few exceptions the virus had made its way around 
the world. The second wave was over, and the world was exhausted. And 
man was about to become the hunter. 
But the virus, even as it lost some of its virulence, was not yet ﬁnished. 
Only weeks after the disease seemed to have dissipated, when town after 
town had congratulated itself on surviving it—and in some places where 
people had had the hubris to believe they had defeated it—after health 
boards and emergency councils had canceled orders to close theaters, 
schools, and churches and to wear masks, a third wave broke over the 
earth. 
The virus had mutated again. It had not become radically different. 
People who had gotten sick in the second wave had a fair amount of 
immunity to another attack, just as people sickened in the ﬁrst wave had 
fared better than others in the second wave. But it mutated enough, its 
antigens drifted enough, to rekindle the epidemic. 
"
"374 
The Great Influenza 
Some places were not touched by the third wave at all. But many—in 
fact most—were. By December 11, Blue and the Public Health Service 
issued a bulletin warning that “inﬂuenza has not passed and severe epi-
demic conditions exist in various parts of the country. . . . In California, 
increase; Iowa, a marked increase; Kentucky, decided recrudescence in 
Louisville and larger towns, and in contrast to earlier stage of epidemic 
disease now affects many schoolchildren; Louisiana, disease again 
increased in New Orleans, Shreveport, [in] Lake Charles height reached 
equalled last wave; . . . St.  Louis 1,700 cases in three days; Nebraska very 
serious; Ohio recrudescences in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Akron, 
Ashtabula, Salem, Medina . . . ;  in Pennsylvania, conditions are worse than 
the original outbreak in Johnstown, Erie, Newcastle. The state of Wash-
ington shows a sharp increase. . . . West Virginia reports recrudescence in 
Charleston.” 
By any standard except that of the second wave, this third wave was a 
lethal epidemic. And in a few isolated areas—such as Michigan—Decem-
ber and January were actually worse than October. In Phoenix for three 
days in a row in mid-January, the new cases set a record exceeding any in 
the fall. Quitman, Georgia, issued twenty-seven epidemic ordinances that 
took effect December 13, 1918, after the disease had seemingly passed. 
Savannah on January 15 ordered theaters and public gathering places 
closed—for a third time—with even more rigid restrictions than before. 
San Francisco had gotten off lightly in the fall wave, as had the rest of the 
West Coast, but the third wave struck hard. 
In fact, of all the major cities in the country, San Francisco had con-
fronted the fall wave most honestly and efﬁciently. That may have had 
something to do with its surviving, and rebuilding itself after, the massive 
earthquake of only a dozen years before. Now on September 21 public 
health director William Hassler quarantined all naval installations, even 
before any cases surfaced in them or in the city. He mobilized the entire 
city in advance, recruiting hundreds of drivers and volunteers and divid-
ing the city into districts, each with its own medical personnel, phones, 
transport and supply, and emergency hospitals in schools and churches. 
He closed public places. And far from the usual assurances that the dis-
ease was ordinary “la grippe,” on October 22 the mayor, Hassler, the Red 
Cross, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Labor Council jointly declared 
in a full-page newspaper ad, “Wear a mask and save your life!” claiming 
"
"Lingerer 
375 
that it was “99% proof against inﬂuenza.” By October 26, the Red Cross 
had distributed one hundred thousand masks. Simultaneously, while 
local facilities geared up to produce vaccine, thousands of doses of a vac-
cine made by a Tufts scientist were raced across the continent on the 
country’s fastest train. 
In San Francisco, people felt a sense of control. Instead of the paralyz-
ing fear found in too many other communities, it seemed to inspire. His-
torian Alfred Crosby has provided a picture of the city under siege, and 
his picture shows citizens behaving with heroism, anxious and fearful but 
accepting their duty. When schools closed, teachers volunteered as nurses, 
orderlies, telephone operators. On November 21, every siren in the city 
signaled that masks could come off. San Francisco had—to that point— 
survived with far fewer deaths than had been feared, and citizens believed 
that the masks deserved the credit. But if anything helped, it would have 
been the organization Hassler had set in place in advance. 
The next day the Chronicle crowed that in the city’s history “one of the 
most thrilling episodes will be the story of how gallantly the city of Saint 
Francis behaved when the black wings of war-bred pestilence hovered 
over the city.” 
They thought that they had controlled it, that they had stopped it. 
They were mistaken. The masks were useless. The vaccine was useless. 
The city had simply been lucky. Two weeks later, the third wave struck. 
Although at its peak it killed only half as many as did the second wave, it 
made the ﬁnal death rates for the city the worst on the West Coast. 
With the exception of a few small outposts that isolated themselves, there 
was by early in 1919 only one place the virus had missed. 
Australia had escaped. It had escaped because of a stringent quaran-
tine of incoming ships. Some ships arrived there with attack rates as high 
as 43 percent and fatality rates among all passengers as high as 7 percent. 
But the quarantine kept the virus out, kept the continent safe, until late 
December 1918 when, with inﬂuenza having receded around the world, 
a troopship carrying ninety ill soldiers arrived. Although they too were 
quarantined, the disease penetrated—apparently through medical per-
sonnel treating troops. 
By then the strain had lost much of its lethality. In Australia the death 
rates from inﬂuenza were far less than in any other Westernized nation 
"
"376 
The Great Influenza 
on earth, barely one-third that of the United States, not even one-quarter 
that of Italy. But it was lethal enough. 
When it struck in January and February, the war had been over for more 
than two months. Censorship had ended with it. And so in Australia the 
newspapers were free to write what they wanted. And, more than in any 
other English-language newspaper, what they wrote of was terror. 
“We are told by some that the inﬂuenza is a return of the old ‘Black 
death,’” reported one Sydney newspaper. Another quoted the classic, 
Daniel Defoe’s Journal of the Plague Year—a work of ﬁction—for advice 
on precautions to take to prevent “the inﬂuenza plague.”And headlines of 
terror ran day after day after day after day: “How They Fought Plagues in 
the Old Days,” “The Pneumonic Plague,” “Fighting the Plague,” “Plagues 
in the Past,”“The Pagans and the Plague,”“Did the Plague Start in NSW?” 
“Catholic Chaplains in Plague Stricken Camps,” “Catholics as Plague 
Fighters.” 
The pandemic itself—even in this its most mild incarnation in the 
developed world—was terrifying enough that those who lived through it 
as children remembered it not as inﬂuenza at all, but as plague. One Aus-
tralian historian in the 1990s was recording oral histories. She was struck 
when people she interviewed mentioned “Bubonic Plague,” and she 
explored the issue further. 
One subject told her, “I can recall the Bubonic Plague, people dying by 
the hundreds around us that was come back from the First World War.” 
Another: “We had to get vaccinated. . . .  And I bear the scar today where 
I was inoculated against the Bubonic Plague.” 
Another: “I can remember the Plague. There were doctors going 
around in cabs with gowns and masks over their faces.” 
Another: “They all wore masks . . . after  the war and how they used to 
be  worried  here  in  Sydney . . . about  the Plague.” 
Another: “We were quarantined, our food was delivered to the front 
door. . . . We  didn’t read about the Bubonic Plague. We lived it.” 
Another: “[T]hey called it the Bubonic Plague. But in France they 
called it bronchial pneumonia. See that’s what they said my brother died 
from. . . .”  
Another: “The Plague. The Bubonic Plague. Yes, I can remember 
that. . . . I always understood it  was the same kind of ﬂu that swept 
"
"Lingerer 
377 
Europe, the Black Death in the Middle Ages. I think it was the same kind 
of thing, it was carried by ﬂeas on rats.” 
Another: “Bubonic Plague . . . I  think it might have been called a form 
of inﬂuenza towards the ﬁnish. . . .  The Bubonic Plague was a thing that 
stuck in my mind . . .” 
Yet this was after all only inﬂuenza, and the inﬂuenza that struck Aus-
tralia in 1919 was weaker than it was anywhere else in the world. Perhaps 
the measure of the extraordinary power of the 1918 virus was this: in 
Australia, without a censored press, the memory that stuck in the mind 
was not of inﬂuenza at all. It was of the Black Death. 
The virus was still not ﬁnished. All through the spring of 1919 a kind of 
rolling thunder moved above the earth, intermittent, unleashing some-
times a sudden localized storm, sometimes even a lightning bolt, and 
sometimes passing over with only a rumble of threatened violence in the 
distant and dark sky. 
It remained violent enough to do one more thing.

he overwhelming majority of victims, especially in the Western 
world, recovered quickly and fully. This was after all only inﬂuenza. 
But the virus sometimes caused one ﬁnal complication, one ﬁnal 
sequela. The inﬂuenza virus affected the brain and nervous system. All 
high fevers cause delirium, but this was something else. An army physi-
cian at Walter Reed Hospital investigating serious mental disturbances 
and even psychoses that seemed to follow an attack of inﬂuenza speciﬁ-
cally noted, “Delirium occurring at the height of the disease and clearing 
with the cessation of fever is not considered in this report.” 
The connection between inﬂuenza and various mental instabilities 
seemed clear. The evidence was almost entirely anecdotal, the worst and 
weakest kind of evidence, but it convinced the vast majority of contem-
porary observers that inﬂuenza could alter mental processes. What con-
vinced them were observations such as these: 
From Britain: “. . . profound mental inertia with intense physical pro-
stration. Delirium has been very common. . . . It  has varied from mere 
confusion of ideas through all grades of intensity up to maniacal excite-
ment.” 
From Italy: “. . . inﬂuenzal psychoses of the acute period . . . as a rule 
subside in two or three weeks. The psychosis, however, may pass into a 
state of mental collapse, with stupor which may persist and become 
actual dementia. In other cases . . . depression and restlessness . . . to

[which] can be attributed the large number of suicides during the pan-
demic of inﬂuenza.” 
From  France:  “. . . frequent  and serious mental disturbances during 
convalescence from and as a result of inﬂuenza. . . .  The mental distur-
bances sometimes took on the form of acute delirium with agitation, vio-
lence, fear and erotic excitation and at other times was of a depressive 
nature . . . fear of persecution.” 
From different U.S. Army cantonments: 
“. . . The mental condition was either apathetic or there was an active 
delirium. Cerebration was slow. . . .  The patient’s statements and assur-
ances were unreliable, a moribund person stating he felt very well. . . . In  
other cases, apprehensiveness was most striking.” 
“. . . The mental depression of the patient is often out of all proportion 
to the other symptoms.” 
“. . . Nervous symptoms appeared early, restlessness and delirium 
being marked.” 
“. . . melancholia, hysteria, and insanity with suicidal intent.” 
“. . . Toxic involvement of the nervous system was evident in all the 
more severe cases.” 
“. . . Many patients lay in muttering delirium which persisted after the 
temperature was normal.” 
“. . . Symptoms referable to the central nervous system were seen at 
times, as twitching of the muscles of the ﬁngers, forearms, and face, . . .  
an active, even maniacal occasional delirium, or more usually the low 
mumbling type.” 
“. . . Infectious psychosis was seen in 18 cases, from simple transient 
hallucinations to maniacal frenzy with needed mechanical restraint.” 
Contemporary observers also linked inﬂuenza to an increase in 
Parkinson’s disease a decade later. (Some have theorized that the patients 
in Oliver Sacks’s The Awakening were victims of the 1918 inﬂuenza pan-
demic.) Many believed that the virus could cause schizophrenia, and in 
1926, Karl Menninger studied links between inﬂuenza and schizophrenia. 
His study was considered signiﬁcant enough that the American Journal of 
Psychiatry identiﬁed it as a “classic” article and reprinted it in 1994. Men-
ninger spoke of the “almost unequalled neurotoxicity of inﬂuenza” and 
noted that two-thirds of those diagnosed with schizophrenia after an 
attack of inﬂuenza had completely recovered ﬁve years later. Recovery

The Great Influenza 
from schizophrenia is extremely rare, suggesting that some reparable 
process had caused the initial symptoms. 
In 1927 the American Medical Association’s review of hundreds of 
medical journal articles from around the world concluded, “There seems 
to be general agreement that inﬂuenza may act on the brain. . . . From  
the delirium accompanying many acute attacks to the psychoses that 
develop as ‘post-inﬂuenzal’ manifestations, there is no doubt that the 
neuropsychiatric effects of inﬂuenza are profound and varied. . . . The  
effect of the inﬂuenza virus on the nervous system is hardly second to its 
effect on the respiratory tract.” 
In 1934 a similar comprehensive review by British scientists agreed: 
“There would appear to be no doubt that inﬂuenza exerts a profound 
inﬂuence on the nervous system.” 
In 1992 an investigator studying the connection between suicide and 
the war instead concluded, “World War I did not inﬂuence suicide; the 
Great Inﬂuenza Epidemic caused it to increase.” 
A 1996 virology textbook said, “A wide spectrum of central nervous 
system involvement has been observed during inﬂuenza A virus infec-
tions in humans, ranging from irritability, drowsiness, boisterousness, 
and confusion to the more serious manifestations of psychosis, delirium, 
and coma.” 
The 1997 Hong Kong virus that killed six of the eighteen people 
infected provided some physical evidence. Autopsies of two victims 
showed “edematous brains.” “Edema” means “swelling.” “Most remark-
ably, bone marrow, lymphoid tissue, liver, and spleen of both patients 
were heavily inﬁltrated with [macrophages]. . . . One patient even had 
such cells on the meninges”—the membranes surrounding the brain and 
spinal cord—“and in the white matter of the cerebrum.” The most likely 
reason for these macrophages to have inﬁltrated the brain was to follow 
the virus there, and kill it. And that 1997 pathology report echoes some 
from 1918: “In cases accompanied by delirium, the meninges of the brain 
are richly inﬁltrated by serous ﬂuid and the capillaries are injected. . . .  
Necropsy in the fatal cases demonstrated congestive lesions with small 
meningeal hemorrhages and especially in islands of edema in the cortical 
substance surrounding greatly dilated small vessels . . . hemorrhages into  
gray matter of the cord . . . [brain] tissue cells were altered in these zones 
of  . . . edema.”

381 
In 2002 Robert Webster, one of the world’s leading experts on the virus 
at St. Jude Children’s Hospital in Memphis, observed, “These viruses do 
from time to time get across to central nervous systems and play hell.” He 
recalled a child in Memphis who was an excellent student, got inﬂuenza, 
and became “a vegetable. I’ve seen enough examples in my lifetime to 
believe . . . inﬂuenza can get into the brain. It’s tenuous but real. Put the 
virus into chickens, it can go up the olfactory nerve and the chicken’s dead.” 
The 1918 virus did seem to reach the brain. The war fought on that 
battleﬁeld could destroy brain cells and make it difﬁcult to concentrate, 
or alter behavior, or interfere with thinking, or even cause temporary 
psychosis. If this occurred in only a minority of cases, the virus’s impact 
on the mind was nonetheless real. 
But that impact would, by terrible coincidence, have a profound effect 
indeed. 
In January 1919 in France, Congressman William Borland of Kansas 
died, the third congressmen to be killed by the virus. That same month 
also in Paris, “Colonel” Edward House, Wilson’s closest conﬁdant, col-
lapsed with inﬂuenza—again. 
House had ﬁrst gotten inﬂuenza during the ﬁrst wave in March 1918, 
was conﬁned to his home for two weeks, went to Washington and relapsed, 
and then spent three weeks in bed at the White House. Although a spring 
attack often conferred immunity to the virus, after the Armistice he was 
struck down a second time. He was in Europe then, and on November 30 
he got up for the ﬁrst time in ten days and met with French premier 
Georges Clemenceau for ﬁfteen minutes. Afterward he noted, “Today is 
the ﬁrst day I have taken up my ofﬁcial work in person for over a week. I 
have had inﬂuenza 10 days and have been exceeding miserable. . . . So  
many have died since this epidemic has scourged the world. Many of my 
staff have died and poor Willard Straight among them.” 
Now, in January 1919, he was attacked still a third time. He was sick 
enough that some papers reported him dead. House wryly called the obit-
uaries “all too generous.” But the blow was heavy: more than a month after 
his supposed recovery he wrote in his diary, “When I fell sick in January I 
lost the thread of affairs and I am not sure that I have ever gotten fully back.” 
There were affairs of some magnitude to attend to in Paris in early 
1919. 
"
"382 
The Great Influenza 
Representatives of victorious nations, of weak nations, of nations 
hoping to be born from the splinters of defeated nations, had all come 
there to set the terms of peace. Several thousand men from dozens of 
countries circled around the edges of decision making. Germany would 
play no role in these decisions; Germany would simply be dictated to. 
And among this host of nations, this virtual Tower of Babel, a Council of 
Ten of the most powerful nations supposedly determined the agenda. 
Even within this tight circle was a tighter one, the “Big Four”—the United 
States, France, Britain, and Italy. And in reality only three of those four 
nations mattered. Indeed, only three men mattered. 
French premier Georges Clemenceau, known as “the Tiger,” negotiated 
with a bullet in his shoulder, put there by an assassination attempt dur-
ing the peace conference on February 19. Prime Minister Lloyd George of 
Great Britain faced such political problems at home he was described as 
“a greased marble spinning on a glass table top.” And there was Wilson, 
who arrived in Europe the most popular political ﬁgure in the world. 
For weeks and then months the meetings dragged on, and tens of 
thousands of pages of drafts and memos and understandings went back 
and forth between ministers and staff. But Wilson, Clemenceau, and 
George did not much need these thousands of pages. They were not sim-
ply ratifying what foreign ministers and staffs had worked out, nor were 
they simply making decisions on options presented to them. They were 
themselves doing much of the actual negotiating. They were bargaining 
and wheedling, they were demanding and insisting, and they were rejecting. 
Often only ﬁve or six men would be in a room, including translators. 
Often, even when Clemenceau and George had others present, Wilson 
represented the United States alone, with no staff, no secretary of state, 
no Colonel House, who by now had been all but discarded as untrust-
worthy by Wilson. Interrupted only by Wilson’s relatively brief return to 
the United States, discussions were interminable. But they were deciding 
the future of the world. 
In October, at the peak of the epidemic in Paris, 4,574 people had died 
there of inﬂuenza or pneumonia. The disease had never entirely left that 
city. In February 1919, deaths in Paris from inﬂuenza and pneumonia 
climbed back up to 2,676, more than half the peak death toll. Wilson’s 
daughter Margaret had inﬂuenza in February; she was kept in bed in

Brussels at the American legation. In March another 1,517 Parisians died, 
and the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that in Paris 
“the epidemic of inﬂuenza which had declined has broken out anew in a 
most disquieting manner. . . .  The epidemic has assumed grave propor-
tions, not only in Paris but in several of the departments.” 
That month Wilson’s wife, his wife’s secretary, Chief White House 
Usher Irwin Hoover, and Cary Grayson, Wilson’s personal White House 
physician and perhaps the single man Wilson trusted the most, were all ill. 
Clemenceau and Lloyd George both seemed to have mild cases of inﬂuenza. 
Meanwhile the sessions with George and Clemenceau were often bru-
tal. In late March Wilson told his wife, “Well, thank God I can still ﬁght, 
and I’ll win.” 
On March 29, Wilson said, “M. Clemenceau called me pro-German 
and left the room.” 
Wilson continued to ﬁght, insisting,“The only principle I recognize is 
that of the consent of the governed.” On April 2, after the negotiations for 
the day ﬁnished, he called the French “damnable”—for him, a deeply reli-
gious man, an extreme epithet. He told his press spokesman Ray Stan-
nard Baker, “[W]e’ve got to make peace on the principles laid down and 
accepted, or not make it at all.” 
The next day, April 3, a Thursday, at three p.m ., Wilson seemed in ﬁne 
health, according to Cary Grayson. Then, very suddenly at six o’clock, 
Grayson saw Wilson “seized with violent paroxysms of coughing, which 
were so severe and frequent that it interfered with his breathing.” 
The attack came so suddenly that Grayson suspected that Wilson had 
been poisoned, that an assassination attempt had been made. But it soon 
became obvious the diagnosis was simpler, if only marginally more reas-
suring. 
Joseph Tumulty, Wilson’s chief of staff, had stayed in Washington to 
monitor political developments at home. Grayson and he exchanged 
telegrams daily, sometimes several times a day. But the information of the 
president’s illness was too sensitive for a telegram. Grayson did wire him, 
“The President took very severe cold last night; conﬁned to bed.” Simul-
taneously he also wrote a conﬁdential letter to be hand-delivered: “The 
President was taken violently sick last Thursday. He had a fever of over 
103 and profuse diarrhoea. . . . [It  was] the beginning of an attack of 
inﬂuenza. That night was one of the worst through which I have ever

passed. I was able to control the spasms of coughing but his condition 
looked very serious.” 
Donald Frary, a young aide on the American peace delegation, came 
down with inﬂuenza the same day Wilson did. Four days later he died at 
age twenty-ﬁve. 
For several days Wilson lay in bed, unable to move. On the fourth day, 
he sat up. Grayson wired Tumulty, “Am taking every precaution with 
him. . . . Your aid and presence were never needed more.” 
Wilson for the ﬁrst time was well enough to have visitors. He received 
American commissioners in his bedroom and said, “Gentlemen, this is 
not a meeting of the Peace Commission. It is more a Council of War.” 
Just before getting sick Wilson had threatened to leave the conference, 
to return to the United States without a treaty rather than yield on his 
principles. He repeated that threat again, telling Grayson to order the 
George Washington to be ready to sail as soon as he was well enough to 
travel. The next day Gilbert Close, his secretary, wrote his wife, “I never 
knew the president to be in such a difﬁcult frame of mind as now. Even 
while lying in bed he manifested peculiarities.” 
Meanwhile the negotiations continued; Wilson, unable to participate, 
was forced to rely on House as his stand-in. (Wilson had even less trust 
in Secretary of State Robert Lansing, whom he largely ignored, than in 
House.) For several days Wilson continued to talk about leaving France, 
telling his wife, “If I have lost the ﬁght, which I would not have done had 
I been on my feet, I will retire in good order, so we will go home.” 
Then, on April 8, Wilson insisted upon personally rejoining the nego-
tiations. He could not go out. Clemenceau and George came to his bed-
room, but the conversations did not go well. His public threat to leave 
had infuriated Clemenceau, who privately called him “a cook who keeps 
her trunk ready in the hallway.” 
Grayson wrote that despite “that ill-omened attack of inﬂuenza, the 
insidious effects of which he was not in good condition to resist, . . .  [the 
president] insisted upon holding conferences while he was still conﬁned 
to his sickbed. When he was able to get up he began to drive himself as 
hard as before—morning, afternoon, and frequently evening conferences.” 
Herbert Hoover, not part of the American peace delegation but a 
large ﬁgure in Paris because he had charge of feeding a desolated and bar-
ren Europe, said, “Prior to that time, in all matters with which I had to 
"
"Lingerer

deal, he was incisive, quick to grasp essentials, unhesitating in conclu-
sions, and most willing to take advice from men he trusted. . . . [Now]  
others as well as I found we had to push against an unwilling mind. And 
at times, when I just had to get decisions, I suffered as much from having 
to mentally push as he did in coming to conclusions.” Hoover believed 
Wilson’s mind had lost “resiliency.” 
Colonel Starling of the Secret Service noticed that Wilson “lacked his 
old quickness of grasp, and tired easily.” He became obsessed with such 
details as who was using the ofﬁcial automobiles. When Ray Stannard 
Baker was ﬁrst allowed to see Wilson again, he trembled at Wilson’s sunken 
eyes, at his weariness, at his pale and haggard look, like that of a man 
whose ﬂesh has shrunk away from his face, showing his skull. 
Chief Usher Irwin Hoover recalled several new and very strange ideas 
that Wilson suddenly believed, including one that his home was ﬁlled 
with French spies: “Nothing we could say could disabuse his mind of this 
thought. About this time he also acquired a peculiar notion he was per-
sonally responsible for all the property in the furnished place he was 
occupying. . . . Coming from the President, whom we all knew so well, 
these were very funny things, and we could but surmise that something 
queer was happening in his mind. One thing was certain: he was never 
the same after this little spell of sickness.” 
Grayson conﬁded to Tumulty, “This is a matter that worries me.” 
“I have never seen the President look so worn and tired,” Ray Baker 
said. In the afternoon “he could not remember without an effort what the 
council had done in the forenoon.” 
Then, abruptly, still on his sickbed, only a few days after he had threat-
ened to leave the conference unless Clemenceau yielded to his demands, 
without warning to or discussion with any other Americans, Wilson sud-
denly abandoned principles he had previously insisted upon. He yielded 
to Clemenceau everything of signiﬁcance Clemenceau wanted, virtually 
all of which Wilson had earlier opposed. 
Now, in bed, he approved a formula Clemenceau had written demand-
ing German reparations and that Germany accept all responsibility for 
starting the war. The Rhineland would be demilitarized; Germany would 
not be allowed to have troops within thirty miles of the east bank of the 
Rhine. The rich coal ﬁelds of the Saar region would be mined by France 
and the region would be administered by the new League of Nations for 
"
"386 
The Great Influenza 
ﬁfteen years, and then a plebiscite would determine whether the region 
would belong to France or Germany. The provinces of Alsace and Lor-
raine, which Germany had seized after the Franco-Prussian War, were 
moved from Germany back to France. West Prussia and Posen were given 
to Poland—creating the “Polish corridor” that separated two parts of 
Germany. The German air force was eliminated, its army limited to one 
hundred thousand men, its colonies stripped away—but not freed, sim-
ply redistributed to other powers. 
Even Lloyd George commented on Wilson’s “nervous and spiritual 
breakdown in the middle of the Conference.” 
Grayson wrote, “These are terrible days for the President physically 
and otherwise.” 
As Grayson made that notation, Wilson was conceding to Italy much 
of its demands and agreeing to Japan’s insistence that it take over Ger-
man concessions in China. In return the Japanese offered an oral—not 
written—promise of good behavior, a promise given not even to Wilson 
personally or, for that matter, to any chief of state, but to British Foreign 
Secretary Alfred Balfour. 
On May 7 the Germans were presented with the treaty. They com-
plained that it violated the very principles Wilson had declared were invi-
olate. Wilson left the meeting saying, “What abominable manners. . . .  
This is the most tactless speech I have ever heard.” 
Yet they had not reminded Wilson and the world that he had once 
said that a lasting peace could be achieved only by—and that he had once 
called for—“A peace without victory.” 
Wilson also told Baker, “If I were a German, I think I should never 
sign it.” 
Four months later Wilson suffered a major and debilitating stroke. For 
months his wife and Grayson would control all access to him and become 
arguably the de facto most important policy makers in the country. 
In 1929 one man wrote a memoir in which he said that two doctors 
believed Wilson was suffering from arteriosclerosis when he went to 
Paris. In 1946 a physician voiced the same opinion in print. In 1958 a 
major biography of Wilson stated that experts on arteriosclerosis ques-
tioned Grayson’s diagnosis of inﬂuenza and believed Wilson had instead 
suffered a vascular occlusion—a minor stroke. In 1960 a historian writ-
"
"Lingerer 
387 
ing about the health of presidents said, “Present-day views are that [Wil-
son’s disorientation] was based on brain damage, probably caused by 
arteriosclerotic occlusion of blood vessels.” In 1964 another historian 
called Wilson’s attack “thrombosis.” In a 1970 article in the Journal of 
American History, titled “Woodrow Wilson’s Neurological Illness,” an-
other historian called it “a little stroke.” 
Only one historian, Alfred Crosby, seems to have paid any attention to 
Wilson’s actual symptoms—including high fever, severe coughing, and 
total prostration, all symptoms that perfectly ﬁt inﬂuenza and have no 
association whatsoever with stroke—and the on-site diagnosis of Grayson, 
an excellent physician highly respected by such men as Welch, Gorgas, 
Flexner, and Vaughan. 
Despite Crosby, the myth of Wilson’s having suffered a minor stroke 
persists. Even a prize-winning account of the peace conference published 
in 2002 observes, “Wilson by contrast had aged visibly and the tic in his 
cheek grew more pronounced. . . . [It] may have been a  minor stroke, a 
forerunner of the massive one he was to have four months later.” 
There was no stroke. There was only inﬂuenza. Indeed, the virus may 
have contributed to the stroke. Damage to blood vessels in the brain were 
often noted in autopsy reports in 1918, as they were in 1997. Grayson 
himself believed that Wilson’s “attack of inﬂuenza in Paris proved to be 
one of the contributory causes of his ﬁnal breakdown.” 
It is of course impossible to say what Wilson would have done had he 
not become sick. Perhaps he would have made the concessions anyway, 
trading every principle away to save his League of Nations. Or perhaps he 
would have sailed home as he had threatened to do just as he was suc-
cumbing to the disease. Then either there would have been no treaty or 
his walkout would have forced Clemenceau to compromise. 
No one can know what would have happened. One can only know 
what did happen. 
Inﬂuenza did visit the peace conference. Inﬂuenza did strike Wilson. 
Inﬂuenza did weaken him physically, and—precisely at the most crucial 
point of negotiations—inﬂuenza did at the least drain from him stamina 
and the ability to concentrate. That much is certain. And it is almost cer-
tain that inﬂuenza affected his mind in other, deeper ways. 
Historians with virtual unanimity agree that the harshness toward 
Germany of the Paris peace treaty helped create the economic hardship, 
"
"388

nationalistic reaction, and political chaos that fostered the rise of Adolf 
Hitler. 
It did not require hindsight to see the dangers. They were obvious at 
the time. John Maynard Keynes quit Paris calling Wilson “the greatest 
fraud on earth.” Later he wrote, “We are at the dead season of our for-
tunes. . . . Never in  the lifetime of men now living has the universal ele-
ment in the soul of man burnt so dimly.” Herbert Hoover believed that 
the treaty would tear down all Europe, and said so. 
Soon after Wilson made his concessions a group of young American 
diplomatic aides and advisers met in disgust to decide whether to resign 
in protest. They included Samuel Eliot Morison, William Bullitt, Adolf 
Berle Jr., Christian Herter, John Foster Dulles, Lincoln Steffens, and Wal-
ter Lippmann. All were already or would become among the most inﬂu-
ential men in the country. Two would become secretary of state. Bullitt, 
Berle, and Morison did resign. In September, during the ﬁght over ratify-
ing the treaty, Bullitt revealed to the Senate the private comments of Sec-
retary of State Robert Lansing that the League of Nations would be 
useless, that the great powers had simply arranged the world to suit 
themselves. 
Berle, later an assistant secretary of state, settled for writing Wilson a 
blistering letter of resignation: “I am sorry that you did not ﬁght our ﬁght 
to the ﬁnish and that you had so little faith in the millions of men, like 
myself, in every nation who had faith in you. Our government has con-
sented now to deliver the suffering peoples of the world to new oppres-
sions, subjections and dismemberments—a new century of war.” 
Wilson had inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza.

n September 29, 1919, Sir William Osler began coughing. One of 
the original “Four Doctors” in a famous portrait of the founding 
faculty of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, a portrait that symbolized 
the new primacy of science in American medicine, he was and still is 
regarded as one of the greatest clinicians in history. A man of wide in-
terests, a friend of Walt Whitman, and author of the textbook that ul-
timately led to the founding of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research, Osler was then at Oxford. 
Osler had already suffered one great loss with the death of his only 
child in the war. Now he suffered as well from a respiratory infection he 
diagnosed as inﬂuenza. In Oxford that fall, inﬂuenza was prevalent enough 
that the dons considered postponing the school term. To his sister-in-law, 
Osler wrote, “For two days I felt very ill & exhausted by the paroxysms” of 
coughing. He seemed to recover, but on October 13 his temperature rose 
to 102.5. He wrote a friend he had “one of those broncho-pneumonias so 
common after inﬂuenza.” He tried to work on a talk about Whitman and 
also wrote Welch and John D. Rockefeller Jr. about giving a grant to his 
alma mater, McGill University. But on November 7, he felt “a stab and 
then ﬁreworks” on his right side. Twelve hours later he began coughing 
again: “A bout arrived which ripped all pleural attachments to smith-
ereens, & with it the pain.” 
"
"390 
The Great Influenza 
After three weeks his physicans took him off morphine, gave him 
atropine, and said they were encouraged. On December 5 he received a 
local anesthetic and a needle was inserted into his lungs to drain fourteen 
ounces of pus. He gave up working on his Whitman talk and felt certain 
now of the end, joking, “I’ve been watching this case for two months and 
I’m sorry I shall not see the post mortem.” 
His wife did not like the joke. His pessimism was crushing her: 
“[W]hatever he says always does come true—so how can I hope for any-
thing but a fatal ending?” She tried to remain optimistic as the disease 
dragged on. But one day she found him reciting a Tennyson poem: “Of 
happy men that have the power to die, / And grassy barrows of the hap-
pier dead. / Release me, and restore me to the ground. . . .” 
He had turned seventy in July. A birthday tribute to him, a 
Festschrift—a collection of scientiﬁc articles in his honor—arrived on 
December 27, entitled, Contributions to Medical and Biological Research, 
Dedicated to Sir William Osler. Publication had been delayed because 
Welch was editing them. Welch never did anything on time. 
His most recent biographer believes that had he been at the Johns 
Hopkins Hospital instead, he would have received better care. Physicians 
would have used x rays, electrocardiograms, earlier surgical intervention 
to drain an empyema, a pocket of pus from the lung. They might have 
saved him. 
He died December 29, 1919, his last words being, “Hold up my head.” 
He had always held his head high. 
If ﬁnally it seemed past, yet it wasn’t past. In September 1919, as Osler 
was dying, Blue predicted that inﬂuenza would return: “Communities 
should make plans now for dealing with any recurrences. The most 
promising way to deal with a possible recurrence is, to sum it up in a sin-
gle word, ‘preparedness.’ And now is the time to prepare.” 
On September 20, 1919, many of the best scientists in the country met 
to try to reach a consensus on the cause of the disease or course of ther-
apy. They could not, but the New York Times stated that the conference 
marked the beginning of a joint federal, state, and city effort to prevent a 
recurrence. Two days later the Red Cross distributed its own conﬁdential 
battle plan internally: “Proposed Staff Organization for Possible Inﬂuenza 
Emergency / Conﬁdential / Note: No publicity is to be given this bulletin 
"
"Lingerer

until . . .  the ﬁrst indication of a recurrence of inﬂuenza in epidemic 
form, but until such time there should be no public statement by a Red 
Cross Chapter or Division ofﬁce.” 
By February 7, 1920, inﬂuenza had returned with enough ferocity that 
the Red Cross declared,“Owing to the rapid spread of inﬂuenza, the safety 
of the country demands, as a patriotic duty, that all available nurses or any-
one with experience in nursing, communicate with the nearest Red Cross 
chapters or special local epidemic committees, offering their services.” 
In eight weeks in early 1920, eleven thousand inﬂuenza-related deaths 
occurred in just New York City and Chicago, and in New York City more 
cases would be reported on a single day than on any one day in 1918. In 
Chicago, Health Commissioner John Dill Robertson, who had been so con-
cerned about morale in 1918, organized three thousand of the most pro-
fessional nurses into regional squads that could range over the entire city. 
Whenever an inﬂuenza case developed, that victim’s home was tagged. 
The year 1920 would see either (sources differ) the second or third 
most deaths from inﬂuenza and pneumonia in the twentieth century. 
And it continued to strike cities sporadically. As late as January 1922, for 
example, Washington State’s health director, Dr. Paul Turner, while refus-
ing to admit the return of inﬂuenza, declared, “The severe respiratory 
infection which is epidemic at this time throughout the state is to be dealt 
with the same as inﬂuenza. . . . Enforce  absolute quarantine.” 
Only in the next few years did it ﬁnally fade away in both the United 
States and the world. It did not disappear. It continued to attack, but with 
far less virulence, partly because the virus mutated further toward its mean, 
toward the behavior of most inﬂuenza viruses, partly because people’s 
immune systems adjusted. But it left a legacy. 
Even before the epidemic ended, New York City Health Commissioner 
Royal Copeland estimated that twenty-one thousand children in the city 
had been made orphans by the epidemic. He had no estimate of children 
who lost only one parent. Berlin, New Hampshire, a tiny town, had 
twenty-four orphaned children not counting, said a Red Cross worker, 
“in one street sixteen motherless children.” Vinton County, Ohio, popu-
lation thirteen thousand, reported one hundred children orphaned by 
the virus. Minersville, Pennsylvania, in the coal regions, had a population 
of six thousand; there the virus had orphaned two hundred children. 
"
"392 
The Great Influenza 
In March 1919 a senior Red Cross ofﬁcial advised district ofﬁcers to 
help wherever possible on an emergency basis, because “the inﬂuenza 
epidemic not only caused the deaths of some six hundred thousand 
people, but it also left a trail of lowered vitality . . . nervous breakdown, 
and other sequella [sic] which now threaten thousands of people. It left 
widows and orphans and dependent old people. It has reduced many of 
these families to poverty and acute distress. This havoc is wide spread, 
reaching all parts of the United States and all classes of people.” 
Months after “recovering” from his illness, the poet Robert Frost won-
dered, “What bones are they that rub together so unpleasantly in the mid-
dle of you in extreme emaciation . . . ? I don’t know whether or  not I’m 
strong enough to write a letter yet.” 
Cincinnati Health Commissioner Dr. William H. Peters told the 
American Public Health Association meeting almost a year after the epi-
demic that “phrases like ‘I’m not feeling right,’ ‘I don’t have my usual pep,’ 
‘I’m all in since I had the ﬂu’ have become commonplace.” Cincinnati’s 
public health agencies had examined 7,058 inﬂuenza victims since the 
epidemic had ended and found that 5,264 needed some medical assis-
tance; 643 of them had heart problems, and an extraordinary number of 
prominent citizens who had had inﬂuenza had died suddenly early in 
1919. While it was hardly a scientiﬁc sample, Peters believed that few vic-
tims had escaped without some pathological changes. 
Throughout the world similar phenomena were noted. In the next 
few years a disease known as “encephalitis lethargica” spread through 
much of the West. Although no pathogen was ever identiﬁed and the dis-
ease itself has since disappeared—indeed, there is no incontrovertible 
evidence that the disease, in a clearly deﬁnable scientiﬁc sense, ever 
existed—physicians at the time did believe in the disease, and a consen-
sus considered it a result of inﬂuenza. 
There were other aftershocks impossible to quantify. There was the 
angry emptiness of a parent or a husband or a wife. Secretary of War 
Newton Baker—who had been criticized for being a paciﬁst when Wilson 
appointed him—particularly took to heart charges that War Department 
policies had in effect murdered young men. In several cases troops from 
Devens were transferred to a post whose commander protested receiving 
them because of the epidemic. The protests were futile, the troops came, 
and so did inﬂuenza. The father of one boy who died at such a camp 
"
"Lingerer 
393 
wrote Baker, “My belief is that the heads of the War Department are 
responsible.” Baker replied in a seven-page, single-spaced letter, a letter of 
his own agony. 
The world was still sick, sick to the heart. The war itself . . .  The sense-
less deaths at home, on top of all else . . . Wilson’s betrayal of ideals at Ver-
sailles, a betrayal that penetrated the soul . . .  The utter failure of science, 
the greatest achievement of modern man, in the face of the disease . . .  
In January 1923 John Dewey wrote in the New Republic, “It may be 
doubted if the consciousness of sickness was ever so widespread as it is 
today. . . .  The interest in cures and salvations is evidence of how sick the 
world is.” He was speaking of a consciousness that went beyond physical 
disease, but physical disease was part of it. He was speaking of the world 
of which F. Scott Fitzgerald declared “all Gods dead, all wars fought, all 
faiths in man shaken.” 
The disease has survived in memory more than in any literature. Nearly 
all those who were adults during the pandemic have died now. Now the 
memory lives in the minds of those who only heard stories, who heard 
how their mother lost her father, how an uncle became an orphan, or 
heard an aunt say, “It was the only time I ever saw my father cry.” Mem-
ory dies with people. 
The writers of the 1920s had little to say about it. 
Mary McCarthy got on a train in Seattle on October 30, 1918, with 
her three brothers and sisters, her aunt and uncle, and her parents. They 
arrived in Minneapolis three days later, all of them sick—her father had 
pulled out a gun when the conductor tried to put them off the train— 
met by her grandparents wearing masks. All the hospitals were full and so 
they went home. Her aunt and uncle recovered but her father, Roy, thirty-
eight years old, died on November 6, and her mother, Tess, twenty-nine 
years old, died November 7. In Memories of a Catholic Girlhood she spoke 
of how deeply being an orphan affected her, made her desperate to dis-
tinguish herself, and she vividly remembered the train ride across two-
thirds of the country, but she said almost nothing of the epidemic. 
John Dos Passos was in his early twenties and seriously ill with 
inﬂuenza, yet barely mentioned the disease in his ﬁction. Hemingway, 
Faulkner, Fitzgerald said next to nothing of it. William Maxwell, a New 
Yorker writer and novelist, lost his mother to the disease. Her death sent 
"
"394

his father, brother, and him inward. He recalled, “I had to guess what my 
older brother was thinking. It was not something he cared to share with 
me. If I hadn’t known, I would have thought that he’d had his feelings 
hurt by something he was too proud to talk about. . . .”  For  himself, 
“[T]he ideas that kept recurring to me, perhaps because of that pacing 
the ﬂoor with my father, was that I had inadvertently walked through a 
door that I shouldn’t have gone through and couldn’t get back to the 
place I hadn’t meant to leave.” Of his father he said, “His sadness was of 
the kind that is patient and without hope.” For himself, “the death of my 
mother . . . was a motivating force in four books.” 
Katherine Anne Porter was ill enough that her obituary was set in 
type. She recovered. Her ﬁancé did not. Years later her haunting novella 
of the disease and the time, Pale Horse, Pale Rider, is one of the best—and 
one of the few—sources for what life was like during the disease. And she 
lived through it in Denver, a city that, compared to those in the east, was 
struck only a glancing blow. 
But the relative lack of impact it left on literature may not be unusual 
at all. It may not be that much unlike what happened centuries ago. One 
scholar of medieval literature says, “While there are a few vivid and terri-
fying accounts, it’s actually striking how little was written on the bubonic 
plague. Outside of these few very well-known accounts, there is almost 
nothing in literature about it afterwards.” 
People write about war. They write about the Holocaust. They write 
about horrors that people inﬂict on people. Apparently they forget the 
horrors that nature inﬂicts on people, the horrors that make humans 
least signiﬁcant. And yet the pandemic resonated. When the Nazis took 
control of Germany in 1933, Christopher Isherwood wrote of Berlin: 
“The whole city lay under an epidemic of discreet, infectious fear. I could 
feel it, like inﬂuenza, in my bones.” 
Those historians who have examined epidemics and analyzed how soci-
eties have responded to them have generally argued that those with 
power blamed the poor for their own suffering, and sometimes tried to 
stigmatize and isolate them. (The case of “Typhoid Mary” Mallon, an 
Irish immigrant in effect imprisoned for twenty-ﬁve years, is a classic 
instance of this attitude; if she had been of another class, the treatment of 
"
"Lingerer 
395 
her might well have been different.) Those in power, historians have 
observed, often sought security in imposing order, which gave them 
some feeling of control, some feeling that the world still made sense. 
In 1918 what might be considered a “power elite” did sometimes be-
have according to such a pattern. Denver Health Commissioner William 
Sharpley, for example, blamed the city’s difﬁculties with inﬂuenza on 
“foreign settlements of the city,” chieﬂy Italians. The Durango Evening 
Herald blamed the high death toll among Utes on a reservation on their 
“negligence and disobedience to the advice of their superintendent and 
nurses and physicians.” One Red Cross worker in the mining regions of 
Kentucky took offense at uncleanliness: “When we reached the miserable 
shack  it  seemed  deserted. . . . I went on in  and there laying with her legs 
out of the bed and her head thrown way back on a ﬁlthy pillow was the 
woman, stone dead, her eyes staring, her mouth yawning, a most grue-
some  sight. . . .  The mother of the woman’s husband came in, an old 
woman living in an indescribable shack some 300 feet away. . . . I  can still 
smell the terrible odor and will never forget the nauseating sight. The 
penalty for ﬁlth is death.” 
Yet, despite such occasional harshness, the 1918 inﬂuenza pandemic 
did not in general demonstrate a pattern of race or class antagonism. In 
epidemiological terms there was a correlation between population den-
sity and hence class and deaths, but the disease still struck down 
everyone. And the deaths of soldiers of such promise and youth struck 
home with everyone. The disease was too universal, too obviously not 
tied to race or class. In Philadelphia, white and black certainly got com-
parable treatment. In mining areas around the country, whether out of 
self-interest or not, mine owners tried to ﬁnd doctors for their workers. 
In Alaska, racism notwithstanding, authorities launched a massive rescue 
effort, if too late, to save Eskimos. Even the very Red Cross worker so 
nauseated by ﬁlth continued to risk his own life day after day in one of 
the hardest-hit areas of the country. 
During the second wave, many local governments collapsed, and those 
who held the real power in a community—from Philadelphia’s bluebloods 
to Phoenix’s citizens’ committee—took over. But generally they exercised 
power to protect the entire community rather than to split it, to distribute 
resources widely rather than to guarantee resources for themselves. 
"
"396 
The Great Influenza 
Despite that effort, whoever held power, whether a city government 
or some private gathering of the locals, they generally failed to keep the 
community together. They failed because they lost trust. They lost trust 
because they lied. (San Francisco was a rare exception; its leaders told the 
truth, and the city responded heroically.) And they lied for the war effort, 
for the propaganda machine that Wilson had created. 
It is impossible to quantify how many deaths the lies caused. It is 
impossible to quantify how many young men died because the army 
refused to follow the advice of its own surgeon general. But while those in 
authority were reassuring people that this was inﬂuenza, only inﬂuenza, 
nothing different from ordinary “la grippe,” at least some people must 
have believed them, at least some people must have exposed themselves 
to the virus in ways they would not have otherwise, and at least some of 
these people must have died who would otherwise have lived. And fear 
really did kill people. It killed them because those who feared would not 
care for many of those who needed but could not ﬁnd care, those who 
needed only hydration, food, and rest to survive. 
It is also impossible to state with any accuracy the death toll. The statis-
tics are estimates only, and one can only say that the totals are numbing. 
The few places in the world that then kept reliable vital statistics 
under normal circumstances could not keep pace with the disease. In the 
United States, only large cities and twenty-four states kept accurate 
enough statistics for the U.S. Public Health Service to include them in 
their database, the so-called registration area. Even in them everyone 
from physicians to city clerks was trying to survive or help others survive. 
Record keeping had low priority, and even in the aftermath little effort 
was made to compile accurate numbers. Many who died never saw a doc-
tor or nurse. Outside the developed world, the situation was far worse, 
and in the rural regions of India, the Soviet Union—which was engaged 
in a brutal civil war—China, Africa, and South America, where the dis-
ease was often most virulent, good records were all but nonexistent. 
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant attempt to quantify the death toll came in 1927. 
An American Medical Association–sponsored study estimated that 21 
million died. When today’s media refers to a death toll of “more than 20 
million” in stories on the 1918 pandemic, the source is this study. 
But every revision of the deaths since 1927 has been upward. The U.S. 
"
"Lingerer 
397 
death toll was originally put at 550,000. Now epidemiologists have settled 
on 675,000 out of a population of 105 million. In the year 2004, the U.S. 
population exceeds 291 million. 
Worldwide, both the estimated toll and the population have gone up 
by a far greater percentage. 
In the 1940s Macfarlane Burnet, the Nobel laureate who spent most 
of his scientiﬁc life studying inﬂuenza, estimated the death toll at 50 to 
100 million. 
Since then various studies, with better data and statistical methods, 
have gradually moved the estimates closer and closer to his. First several 
studies concluded that the death toll on the Indian subcontinent alone 
may have reached 20 million. Other new estimates were presented at a 
1998 international conference on the pandemic. And in 2002 an epi-
demiological study reviewed the data and concluded that the death toll 
was “in the order of 50 million, . . . [but] even  this vast ﬁgure may be sub-
stantially lower than the real toll.” In fact, like Burnet, it suggested that as 
many as 100 million died. 
Given the world’s population in 1918 of approximately 1.8 billion, 
the upper estimate would mean that in two years—and with most of the 
deaths coming in a horrendous twelve weeks in the fall of 1918—in excess 
of 5 percent of the people in the world died. 
Today’s world population is 6.3 billion. To give a sense of the impact 
in today’s world of the 1918 pandemic, one has to adjust for population. 
If one uses the lowest estimate of deaths—the 21 million ﬁgure—that 
means a comparable ﬁgure today would be 73 million dead. The higher 
estimates translate into between 175 and 350 million dead. Those num-
bers are not meant to terrify—although they do. Medicine has advanced 
since 1918 and would have considerable impact on the mortality rate (see 
pages 450–452). Those numbers are meant simply to communicate what 
living through the pandemic was like. 
Yet even those numbers understate the horror of the disease. The age 
distribution of the deaths brings that horror home. 
In a normal inﬂuenza epidemic, 10 percent or fewer of the deaths fall 
among those aged between sixteen and forty. In 1918 that age group, the 
men and women with most vitality, most to live for, most of a future, 
accounted for more than half the death toll, and within that group the 
worst mortality ﬁgures fell upon those aged twenty-one to thirty.

The Great Influenza 
The Western world suffered the least, not because its medicine was so 
advanced but because urbanization had exposed its population to 
inﬂuenza viruses, so immune systems were not naked to it. In the United 
States, roughly 0.65 percent of the total population died, with roughly 
double that percentage of young adults killed. Of developed countries, 
Italy suffered the worst, losing approximately 1 percent of its total popu-
lation. The Soviet Union may have suffered more, but few numbers are 
available for it. 
The virus simply ravaged the less developed world. In Mexico the 
most conservative estimate of the death toll was 2.3 percent of the entire 
population, and other reasonable estimates put the death toll over 4 per-
cent. That means somewhere between 5 and 9 percent of all young adults 
died. 
And in the entire world, although no one will ever know with cer-
tainty, it seems more than just possible that 5 percent—and in the less 
developed countries approaching 10 percent—of the world’s young 
adults were killed by the virus. 
In addition to the dead, in addition to any lingering complications among 
survivors, in addition to any contribution the virus made to the sense of 
bewilderment and betrayal and loss and nihilism of the 1920s, the 1918 
pandemic left other legacies. 
Some were good ones. Around the world, authorities made plans for 
international cooperation on health, and the experience led to restruc-
turing public health efforts throughout the United States. The New Mex-
ico Department of Public Health was created; Philadelphia rewrote its 
city charter to reorganize its public health department; from Manchester, 
Connecticut, to Memphis, Tennessee, and beyond, emergency hospitals 
were transformed into permanent ones. And the pandemic motivated 
Louisiana Senator Joe Ransdell to begin pushing for the establishment of 
the National Institutes of Health, although he did not win his ﬁght until 
a far milder inﬂuenza epidemic in 1928 reminded Congress of the events 
of a decade earlier. 
All those things are part of the legacy left by the virus. But the disease 
left its chief legacy in the laboratory.

y World War I, the revolution in American medicine led by 
William Welch had triumphed. That revolution had radically trans-
formed American medicine, forcing its teaching, research, art, and prac-
tice through the ﬁlter of science. 
Those in the United States capable of doing good scientiﬁc research 
remained a small, almost a tiny, cadre. The group was large enough to be 
counted in the dozens, and, counting the most junior investigators, by 
the mid-1920s it reached several dozen dozens, but no more. 
They all knew each other, all had shared experiences, and nearly all 
had at least some connection to the Hopkins, the Rockefeller Institute, 
Harvard, or to a lesser extent the University of Pennsylvania, the Univer-
sity of Michigan, or Columbia. The group was so small that it still 
included the ﬁrst generation of revolutionaries, with Welch and Vaughan 
and Theobald Smith and a few others still active. Then came their ﬁrst 
students, men only a few years younger: Gorgas, who had reached 
mandatory retirement age from the army days before the war ended— 
the army could have allowed him to remain but he had no friends among 
army superiors—and who then shifted to international public health 
issues for a Rockefeller-funded foundation; Flexner and Park and Cole in 
New York; Milton Rosenau in Boston; Frederick Novy at Michigan; and 
Ludwig Hektoen in Chicago. Then came the next half generation of pro-
tégés: Lewis in Philadelphia; Avery, Dochez, Thomas Rivers, and others at 
"

Rockefeller; George Whipple in Rochester, New York; Eugene Opie at 
Washington University in St. Louis; and a few dozen more. It was only in 
the next generation, and the next, that the numbers of true researchers 
began to multiply enormously and spread throughout the country. 
The bonds that held these men together were not of friendship. Some 
of them—Park and Flexner, for example—had no love for each other, 
many had happily embarrassed a rival by ﬁnding ﬂaws in his work, and 
they had no illusions about each other’s virtues. The profession had 
grown large enough for maneuvering within it. If one listened closely, 
one could hear: “The appointment of Dr. Opie as the primary key man in 
this plan would be a fatal mistake.” Or, “Jordan seems at ﬁrst a rather daz-
zling possibility, but I am a little afraid . . .  that he is not a man who can 
be absolutely certain to stand up for his convictions in a tight place.” Or, 
“Of the names you suggest, I would distinctly prefer Emerson but I fear 
he would be particularly unacceptable to Russell and Cole, and perhaps 
to the [Rockefeller] Foundation group in general, as I have the impres-
sion that he has been somewhat at outs with them.” 
Yet these men also recognized that whatever each other’s ﬂaws might 
be, each of them also had strengths, remarkable strengths. Their work 
was good enough that, even if in error, one could often ﬁnd in that error 
something new, something important, something to build upon. It was 
an exclusive group and, despite rivalries and dislikes, almost a brother-
hood, a brotherhood that included a very few women, literally a handful, 
and in bacteriology these very few women did not extend far beyond 
Anna Williams and Martha Wollstein.* 
All of these scientists had worked frenetically in their laboratories 
from the ﬁrst days of the disease, and none of them had stopped. In those 
most desperate of circumstances, the most desperate circumstances in 
which they—and arguably any scientist—ever worked, most of them had 
willingly, hopefully, accepted less evidence than they would normally 
have to reach a conclusion. For of course as Miguel de Unamuno said, the 
more desperate one is, the more one hopes. But for all their frenzy of

ﬁrst woman to graduate from the Hopkins Medical School, the ﬁrst woman full pro-
fessor at any medical school in the country (at the Hopkins), and the ﬁrst woman

involved in inﬂuenza research, and hence is not a part of this story.

activity, they had still always avoided chaos, they had always proceeded 
from well-grounded hypotheses. They had not, as Avery said with con-
tempt, poured material from one test tube into another. They had not 
done the wild things that had no basis in their understanding of the 
workings of the body. They had not given quinine or typhoid vaccine to 
inﬂuenza victims in the wild hope that because it worked against malaria 
or typhoid it might work against inﬂuenza. Others had done these things 
and more, but they had not. 
They also recognized their failures. They had lost their illusions. They 
had entered the ﬁrst decades of the twentieth century conﬁdent that sci-
ence, even if its victories remained limited, would triumph. Now Victor 
Vaughan told a colleague, “Never again allow me to say that medical sci-
ence is on the verge of conquering disease.” With the contempt one 
reserves for one’s own failings, he also said, “Doctors know no more 
about this ﬂu than 14th century Florentine doctors had known about the 
Black Death.” 
But they had not quit. Now this scientiﬁc brotherhood was beginning 
its hunt. It would take longer than they knew. 
So far each laboratory had been working in isolation, barely communi-
cating with the others. Investigators had to meet, to trade ideas, to trade 
laboratory techniques, to discuss ﬁndings not yet published or that one 
investigator thought unimportant that might mean something to another. 
They had to try to piece together some way to make concrete progress 
against this pestilence. They had to sift through the detritus of their fail-
ures for clues to success. 
On October 30, 1918, with the epidemic on the East Coast fading to 
manageable proportions, Hermann Biggs organized an inﬂuenza com-
mission of leading scientists. Biggs had a proud history, having made the 
New York City municipal health department the best in the world, but, 
fed up with Tammany politics, had left to become state commissioner of 
public health. His commission included Cole, Park, Lewis, Rosenau, epi-
demiologists, and pathologists. Welch, still recovering in Atlantic City, 
was too ill to attend. Biggs opened the ﬁrst meeting by echoing Vaughan: 
“[T]here has never been anything which compares with this in impor-
tance . . . in which we were so helpless.” 
But unlike Vaughan he was angry, declaring their failures “a serious

reﬂection upon public health administration and work and medical sci-
ence that we should be in the situation we now are.” They had seen the 
epidemic coming for months. Yet public health ofﬁcials and scientists 
both had done nothing to prepare. “We ought to have been able to obtain 
all the scientiﬁc information available now or that can be had six months 
from now before this reached us at all.” 
He was determined that they would now address this problem, and 
solve it. 
It would not be so easy. And even in that ﬁrst meeting the problems 
presented themselves. They knew virtually nothing about this disease. 
They could not even agree upon its nature. The pathology was too con-
fusing. The symptoms were too confusing. 
Even this late Cole still wondered if it was inﬂuenza at all: “All who 
have seen cases in the early stage think we are dealing with a new dis-
ease. . . .  One great difﬁculty for us is to ﬁnd what inﬂuenza is and how to 
make the diagnosis. . . . We have been going over all case histories during 
this epidemic and it is almost as difﬁcult to see which is inﬂuenza—a very 
complex picture.” 
A navy scientist observed, “In several places there has been a similar-
ity of symptoms with the bubonic plague.” 
A Harvard investigator dismissed their observations: “It is the same 
old disease and does not change a bit in its character.” 
But it did change, changed constantly, from mild cases of inﬂuenza 
from which victims recovered quickly to cases with strange symptoms 
never associated with inﬂuenza, from sudden violent viral pneumonias 
or ARDS to secondary invaders causing bacterial pneumonias. All these 
conditions were being seen. Lewellys Barker, Cole’s mentor at the Hop-
kins, noted, “The pneumonia specimens which came in from different 
areas are very different. Those from Devens are entirely different from 
those from Baltimore and they differ from several other camps. The 
lesions are quite different in different localities.” 
They reached no consensus about the disease and moved on to dis-
cuss the likely pathogen. There too they could reach not even a tentative 
conclusion. Investigators had found Pfeiffer’s inﬂuenza bacillus, yes, but 
Cole reported that Avery had also discovered B. inﬂuenzae in 30 percent 
of healthy people at the Rockefeller Institute. That proved nothing. It 
might be commonly found now because of the epidemic and be an

unusual ﬁnding in nonepidemic times. Besides, as they all knew, many 
healthy people carried pneumococci in their mouths and did not get 
pneumonia. And in the lungs of epidemic victims they had also found 
pneumococci, streptococci, staphylococci, and other pathogens. Park 
asked about the chances that a ﬁlterable virus caused the disease. Rose-
nau was conducting experiments pursuing that question. 
They knew so little. So little. They knew only that isolation worked. 
The New York State Training School for Girls had quarantined itself, even 
requiring people delivering supplies to leave them outside. It had had no 
cases. The Trudeau Sanatorium in upstate New York had similar rules. It 
had no cases. Across the continent, a naval facility in San Francisco on an 
island that enforced rigid quarantine. It had no cases. All that proved was 
that the miasma theory, which none of them believed in anyway, could 
not account for the disease. 
Yet they ended with agreement. They agreed on lines of approach, on 
the work that needed to be done. Only on that—in effect on how little 
they knew—they could agree. 
They intended to proceed down two paths: one exploring the epide-
miology of the disease, the other tracing clues in the laboratory. The ﬁrst 
task in both lines of attack was to cut through the fog of data that was 
coming in. 
They planned precise epidemiological investigations: correlating 
public health measures and deaths; performing extremely detailed stud-
ies in selected areas, for example, isolating small communities where they 
would account for the seventy-two hours before every single person who 
suffered from inﬂuenza felt the ﬁrst symptoms; taking detailed personal 
histories of both victims and those who had not been attacked; looking 
for linkages with other diseases, with earlier inﬂuenza attacks, with diet. 
The epidemiological studies would have the ancillary beneﬁt of excit-
ing and transforming another emerging ﬁeld of medicine. In November 
1918 the American Public Health Association created a Committee on 
Statistical Study of the Inﬂuenza Epidemic, funded largely by the Metro-
politan Life Insurance Company. One committee member called this “an 
opportunity to show what statistics, especially vital statistics, and its 
methods can do for preventive medicine,” while a colleague saw it as the 
“possible vindication of the theory of probabilities and the method of 
"
"406

random sampling.” In January 1919 the surgeons general of the army, the 
navy, and the Public Health Service also joined with the Census Bureau to 
form an inﬂuenza committee that grew into a permanent statistical ofﬁce. 
Yet at the same time, an epidemiologist present at the ﬁrst meeting of the 
Biggs group said, “I realize the problem has got to be solved ultimately in 
the laboratory.” 
Gorgas had had one goal: to make this war the ﬁrst one in American his-
tory in which battle killed more troops than disease. Even with one out of 
every sixty-seven soldiers in the army dying of inﬂuenza, and although 
his superiors largely ignored his advice, he just barely succeeded— 
although when navy casualties and inﬂuenza deaths were added to the 
totals, deaths from disease did exceed combat deaths. 
Gorgas had largely triumphed over every other disease. U.S. soldiers 
almost entirely escaped malaria, for example, even while it struck down 
tens of thousands of French, British, and Italians. 
Now two million men were returning from Europe. After other wars, 
even in the late nineteenth century, returning troops had carried diseases 
home. British, French, and Russian troops had spread cholera after the 
Crimean War; Americans troops had spread typhoid, dysentery, and 
smallpox after the Civil War; Prussians had brought smallpox home from 
the Franco-Prussian War; and Americans had returned from the Spanish-
American War carrying typhoid. 
One of Gorgas’s last acts was to set in motion plans to prevent any 
such happenings this time. Soldiers were kept isolated for seven days 
before they boarded ships home, and were deloused before embarking. 
Soldiers would be bringing no disease home. 
Meanwhile, the most massive scientiﬁc inquiry ever undertaken was tak-
ing shape. Biggs’s commission met three more times. By the last meeting, 
every member would be serving on other commissions as well. The 
American Medical Association, the American Public Health Association, 
the army, the navy, the Public Health Service, the Red Cross, and the Met-
ropolitan Life Insurance Company all launched major studies in addition 
to those already begun, each of them designed to complement and not 
overlap with the others. At every meeting of every medical specialty, of 
"
"Endgame 
407 
every public health organization, in every issue of every medical jour-
nal, inﬂuenza dominated the agenda. In Europe it was the same. 
Every major laboratory in the United States continued to focus on the 
disease. Lewis in Philadelphia kept after it, as did others at the University 
of Pennsylvania. Rosenau in Boston led a team of Harvard researchers. 
Ludwig Hektoen and Preston Kyes at the University of Chicago stayed 
after it. Rosenow at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota continued to work on 
it. Every member of the army’s pneumonia commission returned to civil-
ian research and continued to investigate inﬂuenza. The Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Company gave grants to university scientists and actually 
subsidized both the city of New York and the federal government, giving 
grants for research by Park and Williams in their New York laboratories 
and by George McCoy of the Public Health Service’s Hygienic Laboratory. 
The army also made “every effort to collect . . . specimens represent-
ing pulmonary lesions due to the present inﬂuenza epidemic,” not only 
from army camps but from civilian sources. These specimens would 
prove enormously important more than three-quarters of a century later, 
when Jeffrey Taubenberger would extract the 1918 inﬂuenza virus from 
them and successfully sequence its genome. 
At the Rockefeller Institute, Cole put “every available man” to work on 
it. He also put Martha Wollstein on it. When Captain Francis Blake, who 
had been part of the army’s pneumonia commission, visited his old col-
leagues at the institute at Christmas, he found everyone “working tooth 
and nail on this inﬂuenza business with monkeys and everything else.” A 
week later, out of the army and back at Rockefeller, he said, “I shall be so 
glad when we can get all this business off our hands and ﬁnished up and 
I can to something else for a change, as it seems as though I have done 
nothing but work on, and eat, and dream about and live with pneumonia 
and inﬂuenza for six months.” 
He would not be free of it any time soon. 
Slowly, over a period of months, a body of knowledge began to form. 
Investigators began to learn about the ﬁrestorm that had roared around 
the world and was continuing to smolder. 
First, they conﬁrmed what they had suspected: the lethal fall disease 
was a second wave of the same disease that had hit in the spring. They 
"
"408 
The Great Influenza 
based their conclusion on the fact that those exposed to the spring wave 
had substantial immunity to the later one. The army had the best records. 
These records involved chieﬂy young men, so they were not useful in 
answering some questions. But they could speak to immunity, and clearly 
demonstrated it. Camp Shelby, for example, was home to the only divi-
sion in the United States that remained in the United States from March 
through the fall. In April 1918 inﬂuenza sickened 2,000 of 26,000 troops 
there enough to seek treatment, many more probably had lesser or sub-
clinical infections, and all 26,000 men were exposed to the disease. Dur-
ing the summer, 11,645 new recruits arrived. In October inﬂuenza 
“scarcely touched” the old troops but decimated the recruits. In Europe 
in the spring, inﬂuenza hit the Eleventh Regiment Engineers, making 613 
men out of a command of 1,200 ill and killing two, but protecting them 
from the lethal wave: in the fall the regiment suffered only 150 “colds” 
and a single death. Camp Dodge had two units of seasoned troops; 
inﬂuenza had struck one group in the spring, and only 6.6 percent of this 
organization caught inﬂuenza in the fall; the other group escaped the 
spring wave, but 48.5 percent of them had inﬂuenza in the fall. And there 
were many other examples. 
Statistics also conﬁrmed what every physician, indeed every person, 
already knew. In the civilian population as well, young adults had died at 
extraordinary, and frightening, rates. The elderly, normally the group 
most susceptible to inﬂuenza, not only survived attacks of the disease but 
were attacked far less often. This resistance of the elderly was a worldwide 
phenomenon. The most likely explanation is that an earlier pandemic 
(later analysis of antibodies proved it was not the 1889–90 one), so mild 
as to not attract attention, resembled the 1918 virus closely enough that 
it provided protection. 
Finally, a door-to-door survey in several cities also conﬁrmed the 
obvious: people living in the most crowded conditions suffered more 
than those with the most space. It also seemed—although this was not 
scientiﬁcally established—that those who went to bed the earliest, stayed 
there the longest, and had the best care also survived at the highest rates. 
Those ﬁndings meant of course that the poor died in larger numbers 
than the rich. (Questions about race and the epidemic yielded contradic-
tory information.) 
"
"Endgame 
409 
But nearly everything else about the disease remained unsettled. Even 
the interplay between the germ theory of disease and other factors was at 
issue. As late as 1926, a respected epidemiologist still argued a version of 
the miasma theory, claiming “a correlation between . . . inﬂuenza and 
cyclic variation in air pressure.” 
In the laboratory, however, the fog remained dense. The pathogen 
remained unknown. Enormous resources were being poured into this 
research everywhere. In Australia, Macfarlane Burnet lived through the 
epidemic as a teenager, and it burned itself into his consciousness. As he 
said soon after receiving the Nobel Prize, “For me as for many others 
interested in bacteriology and infectious disease, the outstanding objec-
tive in medicine for years was . . .  inﬂuenza.” 
Yet all this work had not penetrated the fog. 
The problem did not lie in any lack of clues. The problem lay in dis-
tinguishing the few clues that led in the right direction from all those that 
led in the wrong direction. This was not bubonic plague. That was among 
the easiest pathogens to discover: the bacteria that caused it swarmed in 
the buboes. This was only inﬂuenza. 
As the second wave of inﬂuenza had broken upon the world, thou-
sands of scientists had attacked the problem. In Germany and France 
they had attacked it, in Britain and Italy, in Australia and Brazil, in Japan 
and China. But as 1919 wore away, then 1920, as the disease drifted 
toward mildness, one at a time these thousands began to peel off. They 
found the problem too difﬁcult to conceptualize—to ﬁgure out a way to 
address it—or the techniques seemed too inadequate to address it, or it 
lay too far from their old interests or knowledge base. After two years of 
extraordinary—and continuing—efforts by many of the world’s best 
investigators, in 1920 Welch made a frustrating prediction: “I think that 
this epidemic is likely to pass away and we are no more familiar with the 
control of the disease than we were in the epidemic of 1889. It is humili-
ating, but true.” 
Hundreds of investigators did continue to pursue the question but 
they could agree on little. Everything was in dispute. And central to those 
disputes were the old team of William Park and Anna Williams on one 
side, Paul Lewis and many of those at the Rockefeller Institute on 
another. 
"
"410 
The Great Influenza 
Lewis’s research would end in irony and tragedy. The Rockefeller 
Institute would discover most of its own investigators in error. 
But Oswald Avery would not be in error. Avery would make the most 
profound discovery of them all.

he greatest questions remained the simplest ones: What 
caused inﬂuenza? What was the pathogen? Was Pfeiffer right when 
he identiﬁed a cause and named it Bacillus inﬂuenzae? And if he was not 
right, then what did cause it? What was the killer? 
The pursuit of this question is a classic case of how one does science, 
of how one ﬁnds an answer, of the complexity of nature, of how one 
builds a solid scientiﬁc structure. 
All through the epidemic bacteriologists had had mixed results look-
ing for B. inﬂuenzae. People as skilled as Park and Williams in New York, 
Lewis in Philadelphia, and Avery had all been unable to isolate it from the 
ﬁrst cases they studied. Then they adjusted their techniques, changed the 
medium in which they grew it, added blood heated to a particular tem-
perature to the medium, changed the dyes used for staining, and they 
found it. Park and Williams soon found it so consistently that Park 
assured the National Research Council it was the etiological agent—the 
cause of the disease. The Public Health Service believed it to be the cause. 
Lewis, despite initial misgivings, thought it the cause. 
At Rockefeller, Martha Wollstein had studied Pfeiffer’s bacillus since 
1906. After several years of work she still had not considered her experi-
ments sufﬁciently “clean cut and stable to signify Pfeiffer’s is the speciﬁc 
inciting agent.” But she had continued to study the bacillus, and in the 
midst of the pandemic she had become convinced B. inﬂuenzae did cause 
"
"412 
The Great Influenza 
the disease. She had been so conﬁdent that the vaccine she prepared 
included only Pfeiffer’s bacillus. Her work convinced her Rockefeller col-
leagues as well; they all took her vaccine, even though they were among 
the few in the country with access to the Rockefeller antipneumococcus 
vaccine, which had proven itself effective. 
Midway through the pandemic, failure to ﬁnd Pfeiffer’s seemed a 
mark not of good science but of incompetence. When one army bacte-
riologist failed to ﬁnd it on “blood agar plates from 159 of the ﬁrst 
patients,” the army sent another scientist to the camp to undertake “an 
investigation of the bacteriologic methods employed in the laboratory of 
the base hospital.” Typical of the institution Gorgas had built, it was a 
true investigation, not a witch-hunt, and it concluded that this particular 
laboratory had done “a splendid piece of work. If the inﬂuenza bacillus 
had been present . . . it would have been found.” But that conclusion did 
not come out until long after the epidemic had passed. 
In the meantime the existence of such an investigation told other 
army bacteriologists that inability to ﬁnd B. inﬂuenzae meant they did 
not know their job. Simultaneously, Avery published the new techniques 
he had developed that made it much easier to grow the organism. Bacte-
riologists began to ﬁnd what they were looking for. At Camp Zachary 
Taylor, bacteriologists had been unable to ﬁnd Pfeiffer’s bacillus. Now 
they reported, “More latterly Avery’s oleate medium was used with very 
gratifying results.” They found the bacteria everywhere: in 48.7 percent of 
samples of blood taken directly from the heart, in 54.8 percent of lungs, 
in 48.3 percent of spleens. At Camp Dix, “in every case studied the 
inﬂuenza bacillus was found either in the lungs or in the upper respira-
tory tract or nasal sinuses.” 
In camp after camp, bacteriologists fell into line. Bacteriologists at 
Camp MacArthur in Texas were not alone in their determination “to 
obtain the highest possible incidence of B. inﬂuenzae,” and they found it 
in 88 percent of lungs. But they did so not through any irrefutable labo-
ratory tests; they simply looked through a microscope and identiﬁed the 
bacteria by appearance. Such observations are subjective and not proof, 
only indications. 
At Camp Sherman, where the mortality rate had been the highest in 
the country and the reputations of camp doctors had been called into 
question, the ﬁnal report on the epidemic exempliﬁed the tension. In a 
"
"Endgame 
413 
section written by the bacteriologist, the report said, “The persistent 
absence of inﬂuenza bacilli in the diverse materials examined militated 
against attributing the epidemic to the Pfeiffer organism.” But the section 
written by the pathologist in effect accused the bacteriologist of incom-
petence. The pathologist said he had observed pathogens through the 
microscope that he believed were “Pfeiffer’s organism” and that “all the 
bacteria which were present in this epidemic were not discovered as a 
result of the cultural methods used.” 
Civilian investigators isolated Pfeiffer’s with similar regularity. Yet 
even with all the ﬁndings of Pfeiffer’s B. inﬂuenzae, the picture remained 
confusing. For rarely—even though Avery’s medium inhibited the growth 
of pneumococci and hemolytic streptococci, both of which had often 
been found in inﬂuenza cases—was Pfeiffer’s found alone. 
And sometimes B. inﬂuenzae was still not being found at all. Investi-
gators were especially failing to ﬁnd it in the lungs of victims who died 
quickly. In at least three camps—Fremont in California and Gordon and 
Wheeler in Georgia—the failure to ﬁnd Pfeiffer’s in an overwhelming 
majority of cases simply meant that the bacteriologists, instead of expos-
ing themselves to possible criticism, diagnosed victims of the epidemic as 
suffering from “other respiratory diseases” instead of inﬂuenza. In some 
cases even the most experienced investigators found the bacillus rarely. In 
Chicago, D. J. Davis had studied Pfeiffer’s for ten years, but found it in 
only ﬁve of sixty-two cases. In Germany, where Pfeiffer himself remained 
one of the most powerful ﬁgures in medical science, some researchers 
could not isolate the bacillus either, although he continued to insist it 
caused the disease. 
These reports created increasing doubt about the Pfeiffer’s inﬂuenza 
bacillus. Scientists did not doubt the word of those who found it. They 
did not doubt that the bacillus could cause disease and kill. But they 
began to doubt what ﬁnding it proved. 
There were other questions. In the midst of the epidemic, under the 
greatest pressures, many bacteriologists had compromised the quality of 
their work in the hope of getting quick results. As one scientist said, “It 
requires at least three weeks of concentrated labor to investigate and 
identify the various species of streptococci from a single drop of normal 
sputum smeared on one plate of our culture medium. How then is it pos-
"

sible for two workers to investigate the bacteriology of the respiratory 
tract of, say, 100 cases of inﬂuenza and of 50 normal individuals in one 
year, except in the most slipshod manner?” 
Park and Williams were anything but slipshod. They had been among 
the ﬁrst to proclaim B. inﬂuenzae the likely cause of the epidemic. In 
mid-October, Park still held to that position, declaring, “The inﬂuenza 
bacilli have been found in nearly every case of clear-cut infectious 
inﬂuenza. In the complicating pneumonias, they have been found associ-
ated with either the hemolytic streptococcus or pneumococci. In one case 
the bronchopneumonia was due entirely to the inﬂuenza bacillus. The 
results of the Department of Health of the City of New York have closely 
agreed with those reported from Chelsea Naval Hospital.” 
They had prepared and distributed a vaccine based largely upon their 
conviction. 
But even Park and Williams had made compromises. Now, as the epi-
demic waned, they continued their investigations with great deliberate-
ness. They had always been best at testing hypotheses, looking for ﬂaws, 
improving upon and expanding others’ more original work. Now, chieﬂy 
to learn more about the organism in the hope of perfecting a vaccine and 
serum—but also to test their own hypothesis that B. inﬂuenzae caused 
inﬂuenza—they started an extensive series of experiments. They isolated 
the bacillus from one hundred cases and succeeded in growing twenty 
pure cultures of it. They then injected these cultures into rabbits, waited 
long enough for the rabbits to develop an immune response, then drew 
the rabbits’ blood, centrifuged out the solids, and followed the other steps 
to prepare serum. When the serum from each rabbit was added in test 
tubes to the bacteria used to infect that rabbit, the antibodies in the 
serum agglutinated the bacteria—the antibodies bound to the bacteria 
and formed visible clumps. 
They had expected that result, but not their next ones. When they tested 
these different sera against other cultures of Pfeiffer’s, agglutination 
occurred only four of twenty times. The serum did not bind to the Pfeif-
fer’s in the other sixteen cultures. Nothing happened. They repeated the 
experiments and got the same results. All the bacterial cultures were def-
initely Pfeiffer’s bacillus, deﬁnitely B. inﬂuenzae. There was no mistake in 
that. All twenty of their sera would bind to and agglutinate bacteria from 
"
"Endgame 
415 
the same culture used to infect that particular rabbit. But only four of the 
twenty different sera would bind to any bacteria from another culture of 
Pfeiffer’s. 
For a decade scientists had tried to make vaccine and antiserum for 
Pfeiffer’s inﬂuenza bacillus. Flexner himself had tried soon after Lewis 
left the institute. No one had succeeded. 
Park and Williams believed they now understood why. They thought 
Pfeiffer’s resembled the pneumococcus. There were dozens of strains of 
pneumococci. Types I, II, and III were common enough that a vaccine and 
serum had been made that could protect somewhat against all three, 
though with truly good effect only against Types I and II. So-called Type IV 
wasn’t a type at all: it was a grab-bag designation of “other” pneumococci. 
As they explored Pfeiffer’s further, they became more and more con-
vinced that B. inﬂuenzae similarly included dozens of strains, each differ-
ent enough that an immune serum that worked against one would not 
work against the others. In fact, Williams found “ten different strains in 
ten different cases.” 
In early 1919, Park and Williams reversed their position. They stated, 
“This evidence of multiple strains seems to be absolutely against the 
inﬂuenza bacillus being the cause of the pandemic. It appears to us 
impossible that we should miss the epidemic strain in so many cases 
while obtaining some other strain so abundantly. The inﬂuenza bacilli, 
like the streptococci and pneumococci, are in all probability merely very 
important secondary invaders.” 
The inﬂuenza bacillus, they now said, did not cause inﬂuenza. Anna 
Williams wrote in her diary, “More and more, evidence points to a ﬁlter-
able virus being the cause.” 
Many others were also beginning to think that a ﬁlterable virus caused 
the disease. William MacCallum at the Hopkins wrote, “In Camp Lee we 
found practically no inﬂuenza bacilli. . . . At  the Hopkins Hospital inﬂu-
enza bacilli was rarely found. . . . Since a great many different bacteria 
have been found producing pneumonia, often in complex mixtures, 
it would require very special evidence to prove that one of these is the 
universal cause of the primary disease. And since this particular organ-
ism is by no means always present it seems that the evidence is very weak. 
"
"416 
The Great Influenza 
Indeed, it appears probable that some other form of living virus not rec-
ognizable by our microscopic methods of staining, and not to be isolated 
or cultivated by methods currently in use, must be the cause of the epi-
demic.” 
But the subject remained controversial. No evidence pointed toward a 
ﬁlterable virus except negative evidence—the absence of proof of any-
thing else. And the theory that a virus caused inﬂuenza had already been 
tested by excellent scientists. During the very ﬁrst outbreak of the second 
wave in the United States, Rosenau had suspected a ﬁlterable virus. 
Indeed, he had suspected it at least since 1916. His instincts led him to 
conduct extensive and careful experiments with sixty-two human volun-
teers from the navy brig in Boston. He collected sputum and blood from 
living victims and emulsiﬁed lung tissue of the dead, diluted the samples 
in a saline solution, centrifuged them, drained off the ﬂuid, and passed 
them through a porcelain ﬁlter, then tried various methods to communi-
cate the disease to the volunteers. He used every imaginable method of 
injection, inhalation, dripping into nasal and throat passages, even into 
the eyes, using massive life-risking dosages. None of the volunteers got 
sick. One of the physicians conducting the experiments died. 
In Germany a scientist had also tried, spraying the throats of volun-
teers with ﬁltered nasal secretions, but none of the subjects got inﬂuenza. 
In Chicago a team of investigators failed to infect human volunteers with 
ﬁltered secretions of inﬂuenza victims. Navy investigators in San Fran-
cisco failed. 
Only one researcher in the world was reporting success in transmit-
ting the disease with a ﬁltrate: Charles Nicolle of the Pasteur Institute. 
But Nicolle’s entire series of experiments involved fewer than a dozen 
people and monkeys. He tried four separate methods of transmitting the 
disease and claimed success for three of them. First he dripped ﬁltrate 
into the nasal passages of monkeys and reported they got inﬂuenza. This 
was possible, although monkeys almost never get human inﬂuenza. He 
injected a ﬁltrate into the mucosal membranes around the eyes of mon-
keys and reported they got inﬂuenza. This was theoretically possible, but 
even less likely. He also claimed to have given two human volunteers 
inﬂuenza by ﬁltering the blood from an ill monkey and injecting the ﬁl-
trate subcutaneously—under the men’s skin. Both of the men may have 
gotten inﬂuenza. Neither of them could have gotten it by the method 
"
"Endgame 
417 
Nicolle claimed. Nicolle was brilliant. In 1928 he won the Nobel Prize. 
But these experiments were wrong. 
So, lacking other candidates, many scientists remained convinced 
Pfeiffer’s did cause the disease, including most of those at the Rockefeller 
Institute. So did Eugene Opie, Welch’s ﬁrst star pupil at the Hopkins, who 
had gone to Washington University in St. Louis to model it after the Hop-
kins, and had led the laboratory work of the army’s pneumonia commis-
sion. In 1922 he and several other commission members published their 
results in a book called Epidemic Respiratory Disease. One coauthor was 
Thomas Rivers, who by then had already begun working on viruses; in 
1926 he deﬁned the difference between viruses and bacteria—creating 
the ﬁeld of virology and becoming one of the world’s leading virologists. 
But he spent his ﬁrst ﬁve years after the war continuing to research Pfeif-
fer’s, writing many papers on it even while beginning his viral researches. 
He recalled,“We managed to get inﬂuenza bacilli out of every person that 
had an attack of inﬂuenza. . . . We found it and quickly jumped to the 
conclusion that the inﬂuenza bacillus was the cause of the pandemic.” 
What it came down to was that nearly all investigators believed their own 
work. If they had found the inﬂuenza bacillus in abundance, they 
believed it caused inﬂuenza. If they had not found it, they believed it did 
not cause inﬂuenza. 
Only a very few saw beyond their own work and were willing to con-
tradict themselves. Park and Williams were among these few. In doing so 
they demonstrated an extraordinary openness, an extraordinary willing-
ness to look with a fresh eye at their own experimental results. 
Park and Williams had convinced themselves—and many others— 
that the inﬂuenza bacillus did not cause inﬂuenza. Then they moved on. 
They stopped working on inﬂuenza, partly out of conviction, partly 
because the New York City municipal laboratory was losing the funding to 
do true research. And they were getting old now. 
Through the 1920s, investigators continued to work on the problem. 
It was, as Burnet said, the single most important question in medical sci-
ence for years. 
In England, Alexander Fleming had, like Avery, concentrated on 
developing a medium in which the bacillus could ﬂourish. In 1928 he left 
a petri dish uncovered with staphylococcus growing in it. Two days later 
"
"418 
The Great Influenza 
he discovered a mold that inhibited the growth. He extracted from the 
mold the substance that stopped the bacteria and called it “penicillin.” 
Fleming found that penicillin killed staphylococcus, hemolytic strepto-
coccus, pneumococcus, gonococcus, diphtheria bacilli, and other bacte-
ria, but it did no harm to the inﬂuenza bacillus. He did not try to develop 
penicillin into a medicine. To him the inﬂuenza bacillus was important 
enough that he used penicillin to help grow it by killing any contaminat-
ing bacteria in the culture. He used penicillin as he said, “for the isolation 
of inﬂuenza bacilli.” This “special selective cultural technique” allowed 
him to ﬁnd “B. inﬂuenzae in the gums, nasal space, and tonsils from prac-
tically every individual” he investigated. 
(Fleming never did see penicillin as an antibiotic. A decade later 
Howard Florey and Ernst Chain, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, 
did, and they developed Fleming’s observation into the ﬁrst wonder 
drug. It was so scarce and so powerful that in World War II, U.S. Army 
teams recovered it from the urine of men who had been treated with it, 
so it could be reused. In 1945, Florey, Chain, and Fleming shared the 
Nobel Prize.) 
In 1929 at a major conference on inﬂuenza, Welch gave his personal 
assessment: “Personally I do feel there is very little evidence that [B. 
inﬂuenzae] can be the cause. But when such leading investigators as Dr. 
Opie, for example, feel that the evidence is altogether in favor of Pfeif-
fer’s, and take the further exasperating position that the failure of other 
bacteriologists to ﬁnd it was due to error in technique, to lack of skill, one 
cannot say there is not room for further investigation. . . .  The fact has 
always appealed to me that inﬂuenza is possibly an infection due to an 
unknown virus . . . with this extraordinary effect of reducing the resis-
tance so that the body, at least the respiratory tract, becomes such that 
any organisms are able to invade and produce acute respiratory trouble 
and pneumonia.” 
In 1931, Pfeiffer himself still argued that, of all organisms yet de-
scribed, the pathogen he had called Bacillus inﬂuenzae and that infor-
mally bore his name had “the best claim to serious consideration as the 
primary etiologic agent, and its only competition is an unidentiﬁed ﬁl-
terable virus.”

Avery continued to work on the inﬂuenza bacillus for several years after 
the pandemic. As his protégé René Dubos said, “His scientiﬁc problems 
were almost forced on him by his social environment.” By that he meant 
that the Rockefeller Institute inﬂuenced his choice of problems. If some-
thing mattered to Flexner and Cole, Avery worked on it. 
And he made remarkable progress, proving that passage in animals did 
make the bacillus more lethal and, far more importantly, isolating the fac-
tors in blood that B. inﬂuenzae needed to grow, initially identifying them 
as “X” and “V.” It was extraordinary work, work that marked a milestone 
in understanding the nutritional needs and metabolism of all bacteria. 
But as the likelihood of the inﬂuenza bacillus causing inﬂuenza began 
to fade, the pressure on him to work on it faded also. Although he had 
initially inclined toward the view that it caused inﬂuenza, he became one 
of the increasing number of scientists who believed B. inﬂuenzae had 
been misnamed. He had no inherent interest in the organism and had 
never abandoned his work on the pneumococcus. Far from it. And the 
epidemic had driven home more than ever the lethal nature of pneumonia. 
Pneumonia had done the killing. It remained the captain of the men of 
death. Pneumonia was the target. He returned to his work on the pneu-
mococcus full-time. He would study it for the rest of his scientiﬁc life. 
In fact, as ﬁrst months and then years passed, Avery seemed to limit 
his entire world to the research he himself engaged in. He had always 
focused. Now his focus tightened. Even Dubos said, “I was often sur-
prised and at times almost shocked by the fact that his range of scientiﬁc 
information was not as broad as could have been assumed from his fame 
and from the variety and magnitude of his scientiﬁc achievement.” 
Another time Dubos observed, “He made little effort to follow modern 
trends in science or other intellectual ﬁelds, but instead focused his atten-
tion on subjects directly related to the precise problem he had under 
study. In the lab he was limited to a rather narrow range of techniques, 
which he rarely changed and to which he added little.” 
His interests increasingly narrowed to one interest, the one thing he 
was trying to comprehend: the pneumococcus. It was as if his mind 
became not only a ﬁlter but a funnel, a funnel that concentrated all the 
light and information in all the world on one point only. And at the bot-
tom of this funnel he did not simply sit, sifting through data. He used its 
"
"420 
The Great Influenza 
edges to dig deeper and deeper into the earth, tunneling so deep that the 
only light present was that which he carried with him. He could see noth-
ing but what lay before him. 
And, more and more, he began to narrow his focus even further, to a 
single aspect of the pneumococcus—to the polysaccharide capsule, the 
M&M-like sugar shell surrounding it. The immune system had great 
difﬁculty attacking pneumococci surrounded by capsules. Encapsulated 
pneumococci grew rapidly and unimpeded in the lungs; they killed. 
Pneumococci without capsules were not virulent. The immune system 
easily destroyed them. 
At the lunch tables at the institute, sitting in the comfortable chairs, 
pulling apart baguettes of French bread, drinking an endless supply of 
coffee, scientists learned from each other. The tables were of eight, but 
usually one senior person would dominate a discussion. Avery spoke lit-
tle, even as he grew in stature and seniority; yet he dominated in his own 
way, asking pointed questions about problems that confronted him, 
searching for any ideas that might help. 
Constantly he tried to recruit people whose knowledge comple-
mented his own. He wanted a biochemist, and, beginning in 1921, over 
and over he tried to lure Michael Heidelberger, a brilliant young bio-
chemist, away from the laboratory of Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner. 
Heidelberger recalled, “Avery would come upstairs from his lab and show 
me a little vial of dirty looking dark grey stuff and say, ‘See, my boy, the 
whole secret of bacterial speciﬁcity is in this little vial. When are you 
going to work on it?’” 
Inside the vial were dissolved capsules. Avery had isolated the material 
from the blood and urine of pneumonia patients. He believed that it held 
the secret to using the immune system to defeat pneumonia. If he could 
ﬁnd that secret . . . Eventually Heidelberger did join Avery. So did others. 
And Avery settled into an unchanging routine. He lived on East Sixty-
seventh Street and his laboratory was on Sixty-sixth and York. Every 
morning he walked in at the same time wearing what seemed the same 
gray jacket, took the elevator to his sixth-ﬂoor ofﬁce, and traded the 
jacket for a light tan lab coat. Only if he was doing something unusual, if 
there was a special occasion, would he ever wear a white lab coat. 
But there was nothing routine in this work. He conducted most 
"
"Endgame 
421 
experiments at the lab benches, actually wooden desks originally designed 
for an ofﬁce. His equipment remained simple, almost primitive. Avery 
disliked gadgetry. When he experimented, remembered a colleague, he 
was “intensely focused . . . His movements were limited, but of extreme 
precision and elegance; his whole being appeared to be identiﬁed with 
the sharply deﬁned aspect of the reality that he was studying. Confusions 
seemed to vanish, . . . perhaps simply because everything seemed so or-
ganized around his person.” 
Each experiment created its own world, with possibilities for joy and 
despair. He would leave cultures in an incubator overnight, and each 
morning he and his young colleagues would converge on the incubator 
not knowing what they would ﬁnd. Quiet as he was, reserved as he was, 
he was always tense then, his expression simultaneously eager and fearful. 
In 1923 he and Heidelberger turned the scientiﬁc world on its head by 
proving that the capsules did generate an immune response. The capsules 
were pure carbohydrate. Until then investigators had believed that only a 
protein or something containing proteins could stimulate the immune 
system to respond. 
The ﬁnding only spurred Avery and his colleagues on. More than ever 
he concentrated on the capsule, forsaking practically everything else. He 
believed it to be the key to the speciﬁc reaction of the immune system, the 
key to making an effective therapy or vaccine, the key to killing the killer. 
And he believed that much of what he discovered about the pneumococ-
cus would be applicable to all bacteria. 
Then, in 1928, Fred Grifﬁth in Britain published a striking and puz-
zling ﬁnding. Earlier Grifﬁth had discovered that all known types of 
pneumococci could exist with or without capsules. Virulent pneumo-
cocci had capsules; pneumococci without capsules could be easily destroyed 
by the immune system. Now he found something much stranger. He 
killed virulent pneumococci, ones surrounded by capsules, and injected 
them into mice. Since the bacteria were dead, all the mice survived. He 
also injected living pneumococci that had no capsules, that were not vir-
ulent. Again the mice lived. Their immune systems devoured the unen-
capsulated pneumococci. But then he injected dead pneumococci 
surrounded by capsules and living pneumococci without capsules. 
The mice died. Somehow the living pneumococci had acquired cap-
"
"422 
The Great Influenza 
sules. Somehow they had changed. And, when isolated from the mice, 
they continued to grow with the capsule—as if they had inherited it. 
Grifﬁth’s report seemed to make meaningless years of Avery’s work— 
and life. The immune system was based on speciﬁcity. Avery believed that 
the capsule was key to that speciﬁcity. But if the pneumococcus could 
change, that seemed to undermine everything Avery believed and 
thought he had proved. For months he dismissed Grifﬁth’s work as 
unsound. But Avery’s despair seemed overwhelming. He left the labora-
tory for six months, suffering from Graves’ disease, a disease likely related 
to stress. By the time he returned, Michael Dawson, a junior colleague he 
had asked to check Grifﬁth’s results, had conﬁrmed them. Avery had to 
accept them. 
His work now turned in a different direction. He had to understand how 
one kind of pneumococcus was transformed into another. He was now 
almost sixty years old. Thomas Huxley said, “A man of science past sixty 
does more harm than good.” But now, more than ever, Avery focused on 
his task. 
In 1931, Dawson, then at Columbia University but still working closely 
with Avery, and an assistant succeeded in changing—in a test tube—a 
pneumococcus that lacked a capsule into one that had a capsule. The next 
year people in Avery’s own laboratory managed to use a cell-free extract 
from dead encapsulated pneumococci to do the same thing, to make bac-
teria without capsules change into ones with capsules. 
One after another the young scientists in his laboratory moved on. 
Avery kept on. By the late 1930s he was working with Colin MacLeod 
and Maclyn McCarty, and they now turned all their energies to under-
standing how this happened. If Avery had demanded precision before, 
now he demanded virtual perfection, irrefutability. They grew huge 
amounts of virulent Type III pneumococci, and spent not just hours or 
days but months and years breaking the bacteria down, looking at each 
constituent part, trying to understand. The work was of the utmost 
tedium, and it was work that yielded failure after failure after failure after 
failure. 
Avery’s name was appearing on fewer and fewer papers. Much of that 
was because he put his name on papers of people in his laboratory only if 
he had physically performed an experiment included in the research the 
"
"Endgame 
423 
paper detailed, no matter how much he had contributed conceptually to 
the work, or how often he had talked over ideas with the investigator. 
(This was highly generous of Avery; usually a laboratory chief puts his or 
her name on virtually every paper anyone in his laboratory writes. Dubos 
recalled that he worked under Avery for fourteen years, that Avery inﬂu-
enced nearly all his work but only four times did Avery’s name appear on 
his papers. Another young investigator said, “I had always felt so deeply 
that I was an associate of Avery that . . . with great astonishment I real-
ized for the ﬁrst time that we had never published a joint paper.”) 
But Avery was also publishing less because he had little to report. The 
work was extraordinarily difﬁcult, pushing the limits of the technically 
possible. Disappointment is my daily bread, he had said. I thrive on it. But 
he did not thrive. Often he thought of abandoning the work, abandoning 
all of it. Yet every day he continued to ﬁll nearly every waking hour with 
thinking about it. Between 1934 and 1941 he published nothing. Nothing. 
For a scientist to go through such a dry period is more than depressing. 
It is a refutation of one’s abilities, of one’s life. But in the midst of that dry 
spell, Avery told a young researcher there were two types of investigators: 
most “go around picking up surface nuggets, and whenever they can spot 
a surface nugget of gold they pick it up and add it to their collection. . . .  
[The other type] is not really interested in the surface nugget. He is 
much more interested in digging a deep hole in one place, hoping to hit a 
vein. And of course if he strikes a vein of gold he makes a tremendous 
advance.” 
By 1940 he had gone deep enough to believe he would ﬁnd some-
thing, something of value. Between 1941 and 1944, he again published 
nothing. But now it was different. Now what he was working on excited 
him as nothing else had. He was gaining conﬁdence that he would reach 
his destination. Heidelberger recalled, “Avery would come and talk about 
his work on the transforming substance. . . . There  was something that 
told him that this transforming substance was something really funda-
mental to biology, . . . to  the understanding of life itself.” 
Avery loved an Arab saying: “The dogs bark, the caravan moves on.” 
He had nothing to publish because his work was being done chieﬂy by 
subtraction. But it was moving on. He had isolated whatever transformed 
the pneumococcus. Now he was analyzing that substance by eliminating 
one possibility after another. 
"
"424 
The Great Influenza 
First, he eliminated proteins. Enzymes that deactivated proteins had 
no effect on the substance. Then he eliminated lipids—fatty acids. Other 
enzymes that destroyed lipids had no effect on the ability of this sub-
stance to transform pneumococci. He eliminated carbohydrates. What he 
had left was rich in nucleic acids, but an enzyme isolated by Dubos that 
destroys ribonucleic acid had no effect on the transforming substance 
either. Each of these steps had taken months, or years. But he could see 
it now. 
In 1943 he nominally retired and became an emeritus member of the 
institute. His retirement changed nothing. He worked exactly as he 
always had, experimenting, pushing, tightening. That year he wrote his 
younger brother, a physician, about extraordinary ﬁndings and in April 
informed the institute’s Board of Scientiﬁc Directors. His ﬁndings would 
revolutionize all biology, and his evidence seemed beyond solid. Other 
scientists who had found what he had found would have published 
already. Still he would not publish. One of his junior colleagues asked, 
“Fess, what more do you want?” 
But he had been burned so long ago in that very ﬁrst work at Rocke-
feller, when he had published a sweeping theory encompassing bacterial 
metabolism, virulence, and immunity. He had been wrong, and he never 
forgot the humiliation. He did more work. Then, ﬁnally, in November 
1943 he, MacLeod, and McCarty submitted a paper titled “Studies on the 
Chemical Nature of the Substance Inducing Transformation of Pneumo-
coccal Types. Induction of Transformation by a Desoxyribonucleic Acid 
Fraction Isolated from Pneumoccus Type III” to the Journal of Experi-
mental Medicine, the journal founded by Welch. In February 1944 the 
journal published the paper. 
DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid, had been isolated in the late 1860s by a 
Swiss investigator. No one knew its function. Geneticists ignored it. The 
molecule seemed far too simple to have anything to do with genes or 
heredity. Geneticists believed that proteins, which are far more complex 
molecules, carried the genetic code. Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty wrote, 
“The inducing substance has been likened to a gene, and the capsular 
antigen which is produced in response to it has been regarded as a gene 
product.” 
Avery had found that the substance that transformed a pneumo-
coccus from one without a capsule to one with a capsule was DNA. Once 
"
"Endgame 
425 
the pneumococcus changed, its progeny inherited the change. He had 
demonstrated that DNA carried genetic information, that genes lay 
within DNA. 
His experiments were exquisite, elegant, and irrefutable. A Rockefeller 
colleague conducted conﬁrming experiments on Pfeiffer’s B. inﬂuenzae. 
Among historians of science, there has been some controversy over 
how much immediate impact Avery’s paper had, largely because one 
geneticist, Gunther Stent, wrote that it “had little inﬂuence on thought 
about the mechanisms of heredity for the next eight years.” And Avery’s 
conclusions were not immediately accepted as true by the broad scientiﬁc 
community. 
But they were accepted as true by the scientists who mattered. 
Prior to Avery’s discovery—and proof—that DNA carried the genetic 
code, he was being seriously considered for the Nobel Prize for his life-
time of contributions to knowledge of immunochemistry. But then came 
his revolutionary paper. Instead of guaranteeing him the prize, the Nobel 
Committee found it too revolutionary, too startling. A prize would en-
dorse his ﬁndings and the committee would take no such risk, not until 
others conﬁrmed them. The ofﬁcial history of the organization that gives 
the prize states, “Those results were obviously of fundamental impor-
tance, but the Nobel Committee found it desirable to wait until more 
became known. . . .” 
Others were determined to make more known. 
James Watson, with Francis Crick the codiscoverer of the structure of 
DNA, wrote in his classic The Double Helix that “there was general 
acceptance that genes were special types of protein molecules” until 
“Avery showed that hereditary traits could be transmitted from one bac-
terial cell to another by puriﬁed DNA molecules. . . . Avery’s experiments  
strongly suggested that future experiments would show that all genes 
were  composed  of  DNA. . . . Avery’s experiment made [DNA]  smell like 
the essential genetic material. . . . Of  course there were scientists who 
thought the evidence favoring DNA was inconclusive and preferred to 
believe that genes were protein molecules. Francis, however, did not 
worry about these skeptics. Many were cantankerous fools who always 
backed the wrong horses, . . .  not only narrow-minded and dull, but also 
just stupid.” 
"
"426 
The Great Influenza 
Watson and Crick were not the only investigators seeking the great 
prize, the greatest prize, the key to heredity and possibly to life, who 
immediately grasped the signiﬁcance of Avery’s work. Erwin Chargaff, a 
chemist whose ﬁndings were crucial to Watson and Crick’s understand-
ing enough about the DNA molecule to determine its structure, said, 
“Avery gave us the the ﬁrst text of a new language, or rather he showed us 
where to look for it. I resolved to search for this text.” 
Max Delbruck, who was trying to use viruses to understand heredity, 
said, “He was very attentive to what we were doing and we were very 
attentive to what he was doing. . . .  [I]t was obvious that he had some-
thing interesting there.” 
Salvador Luria, who worked with Delbruck—Watson was a graduate 
student under him—similarly rejected Stent’s contention that Avery’s 
ﬁndings were ignored. Luria recalled having lunch with Avery at the 
Rockefeller Institute and discussing the implications of his work with 
him: “I think it is complete nonsense to say that we were not aware.” 
Peter Medawar observed, “The dark ages of DNA came to an end in 
1944 with” Avery. Medawar called the work “the most interesting and 
portentous biological experiment of the 20th century.” 
Macfarlane Burnet was, like Avery, studying infectious diseases, not 
genes, but in 1943 he visited Avery’s laboratory and left astounded. Avery, 
he said, was doing “nothing less than the isolation of a pure gene in the 
form of desoxyribonucleic acid.” 
In fact, what Avery accomplished was a classic of basic science. He 
started his search looking for a cure for pneumonia and ended up, as 
Burnet observed, “opening . . .  the ﬁeld of molecular biology.” 
Watson, Crick, Delbruck, Luria, Medawar, and Burnet all won the 
Nobel Prize. 
Avery never did. 
Rockefeller University—the former Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research—did name a gate after him, the only such honor accorded to 
anyone. And the National Library of Medicine has produced a series of 
online proﬁles of prominent scientists; it made Avery the ﬁrst to be so 
honored. 
Oswald Avery was sixty-seven years old when he published his paper 
on “the transforming principle.” He died eleven years later in 1955, two 
years after Watson and Crick unfolded DNA’s structure. He died in

Nashville where he had gone to live to be near his brother, his family. 
Dubos compared his death to that of Welch, in 1934, and quoted Simon 
Flexner on Welch’s exit from the stage: “While his body suffered, his mind 
struggled to maintain before the world the same placid exterior that had 
been his banner and his shield. Popsy, the physician who had been so 
greatly beloved, died as he had lived, keeping his own counsel and essen-
tially alone.”

n the first years after the pandemic, Paul Lewis continued to head 
the Henry Phipps Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Yet Lewis was not a happy man. He was one of those who continued 
to believe that B. inﬂuenzae caused the disease and continued to work on 
it after the epidemic passed. There was irony in that, since he had initially 
been reluctant to embrace its etiological role, suspecting instead a ﬁlter-
able virus. Perhaps the chief reason for his stubbornness was his own 
experience. He had not only found the bacillus with consistency, but he 
had produced a vaccine that seemed to work. True, the navy had admin-
istered a vaccine prepared according to his methods to several thousand 
men and it had proven ineffective, but he had not made that vaccine him-
self. A smaller batch that he had personally prepared and tested—during 
the peak of the epidemic, not in its later stages when many vaccines 
seemed to be working only because the disease itself was weakening— 
had given solid evidence of effectiveness. Only three of sixty people who 
received the vaccine developed pneumonia, and none died; a control 
group had ten pneumonias and three deaths. 
Those results deceived him. In the past he had not always made the 
right scientiﬁc judgment—no investigator does—but this may have been 
his ﬁrst signiﬁcant scientiﬁc error. And it seemed to mark the beginning 
of a downhill slope for him. 
That was not obvious at ﬁrst. He had already built an international 
"
"Endgame 
429 
reputation. The German scientiﬁc journal Zeitschrift für Tuberkulose 
translated and reprinted his work. In 1917 he was invited to give the 
annual Harvey Lecture on tuberculosis, a great honor; Rufus Cole, for 
example, would not receive that invitation for another decade. Eighty-
ﬁve years later, Dr. David Lewis Aronson, a scientist—whose father, a 
prize-winning scientist, had worked in the best European laboratories 
and considered Lewis the smartest man he ever met and gave his son 
Lewis’s name—recalled reading that speech: “You could see Lewis’s mind 
working, the depth of it, and vision, going well beyond what was going on 
at the time.” 
Lewis’s views had broadened indeed. His interests now included 
mathematics and biophysics, and, with no resources of his own, he asked 
Flexner to “arrange for the support” of a physicist Lewis wanted to lure 
into medicine to examine ﬂuorescent dyes and “the disinfectant power of 
light and the penetrating power of light for animal tissues.” Flexner did 
so, and Flexner continued to be impressed by Lewis’s own work, replying 
by return mail when Lewis sent him a paper, saying that he would pub-
lish it in the Journal of Experimental Medicine, calling it “interesting and 
important.” 
Yet Lewis’s life after the war began pulling him away from the labora-
tory, frustrating him. Henry Phipps, the U.S. Steel magnate who had 
given his name to the institute Lewis headed, had not endowed it gener-
ously. Lewis’s own salary had risen well enough, from $3,500 a year when 
he started in 1910 to $5,000 just before the war. Flexner still considered 
him vastly underpaid and saw to it that, immediately after the war, the 
University of California at Berkeley offered him a professorship. Lewis 
declined, but Penn raised his salary to $6,000, a substantial income at that 
time. 
But if his own salary was more than adequate, he needed to fund an 
entire institute, even if a small one. He needed money for centrifuges, 
glassware, heating, not to mention “dieners”—the word still in use for 
technicians—and young scientists. He needed to raise the money for all 
that himself. As a result Lewis more and more found himself drawn into 
the social milieu of Philadelphia, raising money, being charming. More 
and more he was becoming a salesman, selling both the institute and 
himself. He hated it. He hated the time it took from the laboratory, the 
drain of his energies, the parties. And the country was in the midst of a 
"
"430 
The Great Influenza 
deep recession, with four million soldiers suddenly thrown back onto the 
job market, with the government no longer building ships and tanks, 
with Europe desolate and unable to buy anything. Raising money was 
more than just difﬁcult. 
In 1921 the University of Iowa approached him. They wanted to 
become a ﬁrst-class research institution, and they wanted him to run the 
program, to build the institution. The state would supply the money. 
Flexner was more than just a mentor to Lewis, and Lewis conﬁded in him 
that the Iowa job seemed “heavy, safe and of limited inspiration. You 
know very well that I do not thrive on routine.” And at Phipps, “Some of 
the work underway has great potential I believe. . . . You will  see that I am 
trying to convince myself that I have a right to gamble here as against a 
rather dull safe outlook at Iowa City. A word from you would be much 
appreciated.” 
Flexner advised him to accept the offer: “All I have heard of the med-
ical situation at Iowa City is favorable, . . . a pretty  sharp contrast to the 
[situation] in Philadelphia. It is deﬁnite and has the elements of perma-
nency. . . . I have no doubt under the inﬂuence of your vigorous guid-
ance, the department—although quite large—over which you would 
preside would become so notable that the State would stand back of you 
in any enlargement.” 
He did not tell Lewis how well he thought the job might suit him, how 
extraordinary his gifts for a job like that were. But Flexner did tell a sen-
ior colleague that Lewis “might really come to exercise a real inﬂuence in 
medical teaching and research.” There was perhaps some of what Welch 
had in him, that Lewis had “quite unusual gifts of exposition.” He had 
broad knowledge, perhaps he even leaked knowledge, and, whether he 
realized it or not, he could inspire. Indeed, Flexner believed he could “be 
master of the ﬁeld.” 
The University of Pennsylvania countered the offer: it gave him a new 
title, raised his salary to $8,000, guaranteed it for ﬁve years, and guaran-
teed funding for the institute itself for two years. He stayed. Flexner con-
gratulated “you and the University especially on your new honor. Will the 
new chair add to your University responsibility?” 
It would. Partly for that reason Lewis remained restless. He had 
rejected the Iowa position because, though it might allow him to build a 
major institution, it would keep him out of the laboratory. Now he found 
"
"Endgame 
431 
himself in much the same situation at Penn. He detested maneuvering 
with or around deans and he continued to play the role of social creature. 
Scientists were the new thing, Faustian ﬁgures able to create worlds and 
fashionable to show off on the Main Line. Lewis hated being shown off. 
There was tension at home with his wife as well. How much of that came 
from his research frustrations, how much because his wife liked the 
Philadelphia society that he wanted no part of, how much because his 
wife simply wanted more of him, it is impossible to know. 
One research project in particular seemed to be going well, and he 
wanted to attend to it, and give up everything else. He envied not only 
Avery’s ability to concentrate on one thing but also his opportunity to do 
so. For Lewis everything seemed to press upon him. Indeed, everything 
seemed ready to explode. 
In 1922 Iowa offered him the position again. This time he accepted. 
He felt a responsibility to leave Phipps in good shape and recruited 
Eugene Opie from Washington University to replace him. Opie had if 
anything an even greater reputation than his own. 
Flexner had always respected Lewis, yet there had always been a gap 
between them. They had been getting closer. At one point Flexner wrote 
him,“Some time do let me take a little trouble for you.” Lewis conﬁded in 
return, “You have stood in the light of ‘father’ to me.” Now, when Opie 
agreed to replace Lewis at Phipps, Flexner seemed to see Lewis in a new 
light, capable not only as a scientist but as someone who could play 
another game well, telling him,“Opie surprised me. I supposed him a ﬁx-
ture in St. Louis. If you prepared the way for so good a man at the Phipps 
Institute, you may well feel gratiﬁed.” 
Lewis did not feel gratiﬁed. He remained restless and discontented. 
What he really wanted was to be shut of everything, everything except the 
laboratory. Perhaps without quite realizing it, he had been moving 
toward a crisis. Again he told Flexner that what he really wanted more 
than anything was to work at his laboratory bench. He was shut of 
Philadelphia. Now he had to get himself shut of Iowa. 
In January 1923 he wrote Flexner, “It is quite clear to me today that I 
am entitled again for a short time at least to cultivate my personal inter-
ests. . . . I am giving up my place here and all of my plans for a future in 
Philadelphia. . . . I have written to President Jessop, of the University of 
Iowa, telling him of my change of plan and that that is also in the dis-
"
"432 
The Great Influenza 
card. . . . I am going to try my best to develop the opportunity for a year 
of study in some place as far removed from any question of ‘affairs or 
position’ as possible. . . . I  cannot make it too plain that for the coming 
year I am seeking no position in the conventional sense of the word. 
What I really want is . . .  the rehabilitation of a more or less vacant 
mind.” 
He was quitting everything, walking away from position, prestige, and 
money, walking into the wilderness with no guarantee of anything, strip-
ping himself naked at the age of forty-four with a wife and two children. 
He was free. 
Where he had been happiest in his life, where he had done the best sci-
ence, had been at the Rockefeller Institute. The institute had created 
a Division of Animal Pathology in Princeton, close to Philadelphia. 
Theobald Smith, the same man who had rejected Welch’s offer to become 
the ﬁrst head of the Rockefeller Institute itself, had left Harvard and now 
headed this division. Smith had also been Lewis’s ﬁrst mentor, and had 
recommended him so many years before to Flexner. Lewis explored with 
Smith the possibility of going to Princeton. Smith ﬁrst wanted assurances 
that Lewis wanted “to go to work again and . . .  that all this advertising 
business had not gone to [his] head.” Lewis eagerly gave them. 
Flexner had urged him to take the Iowa job but replied, “I shall be 
rejoiced to see you return to the lab where you so naturally belong and in 
which you will do your best, most lasting, and effective work. It seems to 
me a crying pity that men who have given years to the necessary prepara-
tion for a lab career should be so ruthlessly drawn away from it and made 
to ﬁll executive positions.” He also told Lewis that Smith was “very 
pleased with the prospect of having you associated with him again.” 
Lewis asked for no salary whatsoever, just full access to the laborato-
ries for a year. Flexner gave him $8,000, his salary at Phipps, and a budget 
for laboratory equipment, ﬁling cabinets, 540 animal cages for breeding 
and experimenting, and three assistants. He told Lewis he would expect 
nothing whatsoever from him for the year, and then they could talk again 
about the future. 
Lewis was ecstatic: “To start with Dr. Smith again on any possible 
basis, takes me back to 1905—on I hope certainly a new higher level. . . .  
You will not ﬁnd me lacking in effort. . . . I am  most fortunate and happy

in being able to regard myself as entirely in the hands of you two men 
who, without distinction, and excepting only my parents, have given me 
the means and the education and the direction. Few have such a chance 
to renew their youth. My only hope is that I continue to deserve your 
conﬁdence.” 
Princeton then was still surrounded by farms and countryside. It was 
peaceful, almost bucolic. The Rockefeller facility was not far from the 
campus of Princeton University, which was still transforming itself from 
the ﬁnishing school for gentlemen that F. Scott Fitzgerald described to 
the intellectual center that it would not fully become until a decade later, 
when Flexner’s brother Abraham started the Institute for Advanced 
Study with Einstein as its ﬁrst member. But if the setting was bucolic, if 
crops grew and assorted animals—not simply guinea pigs or rabbits but 
cattle, pigs, and horses—grazed only yards from the laboratories, the 
Rockefeller part of Princeton brewed intensity. Smith was continuing to 
produce world-class work. Just being around him energized Lewis. For 
the ﬁrst time since he left the Rockefeller Institute, he felt at home. Yet he 
was alone. His wife and children stayed in Philadelphia. He was alone to 
work, alone to go to the laboratory in the middle of the night, alone with 
his thoughts. 
In nearly a year, however, he produced nothing. Flexner and he did 
discuss his future. He was forty-ﬁve years old. His next move would likely 
be his last one. He could still return to the University of Pennsylvania if 
he chose. He did not so choose, telling Flexner, “I can only repeat that I 
am free of any entanglement there, even of sentiment.” The University of 
Iowa had also extended its offer once again and once again raised the 
salary. But what he wanted was to stay at Rockefeller. He had made little 
progress on the tuberculosis project he had brought with him from 
Philadelphia, but, more importantly, he had, he assured himself as much 
as Flexner, rejuvenated himself. He informed Flexner that, despite the 
higher salary at Iowa, “My only interest in ‘position’ is [here].” 
Lewis’s presence ﬁtted perfectly into Flexner’s own plans. Flexner 
explained, “I have always believed that our departments should not be 
one man affairs.” In New York a dozen or more extraordinary investiga-
tors led groups of younger researchers, each group working on a major 
problem. The Princeton location had not developed similarly; beyond 
"
"434 
The Great Influenza 
Smith’s own operation, it had not ﬁlled out. Flexner told Lewis, “Your 
coming . . .  [offers] the ﬁrst chance to make a second center there.” 
Further, Smith would turn sixty-ﬁve that year. Flexner and Smith and 
even Welch hinted to Lewis that he might succeed Smith when he retired. 
Flexner suggested that Lewis stay one more year under a temporary 
arrangement, and then they would see. 
Lewis told Flexner, “I am secure as I never was before.” He believed he 
was home. It would be his last home. 
If Lewis was going to build a department, he needed a young scientist— 
someone with more than just laboratory skills, someone with ideas. His 
contacts in Iowa urged him to try a young man they thought would make 
a mark. 
Richard Shope was the son of a physician who was also a farmer. He 
had gotten his medical degree at the University of Iowa, then spent a year 
teaching pharmacology at the medical school and experimenting on 
dogs. An outstanding college track athlete, tall, a man’s man at ease with 
himself—something Lewis never quite seemed to be—Shope always 
maintained contact with the wild, with the forest, with hunting, not only 
in the laboratory but with a gun in his hands. His mind had a certain 
wildness, too, like a small boy playing with a chemistry set hoping for an 
explosion; he had more than an inquiring mind, he had an original one. 
Years later Thomas Rivers, the virologist who not only succeeded Cole 
as head of the Rockefeller Institute Hospital but served as president of 
four different scientiﬁc associations, said, “Dick Shope is one of the ﬁnest 
investigators  I  have  ever  seen. . . . A  stubborn guy, and he is tough, . . .  
Dick would no sooner start to work on a problem than he would make a 
fundamental discovery. It never made one bit of difference where he 
was.” In World War II, Rivers and Shope landed on Guam soon after 
combat troops secured it (in Okinawa they would come under ﬁre) to 
investigate tropical diseases that might threaten soldiers. While there, 
Shope occupied himself by isolating an agent from a fungus mold that 
mitigated some viral infections. Ultimately he was elected to member-
ship in the National Academy of Sciences. 
Yet even with Shope’s help, Lewis’s work did not go well. It was not for 
lack of intelligence on Lewis’s part. Shope knew Welch, Flexner, Smith, 
Avery and many Nobel laureates well, yet he considered Lewis a notch 
"
"Endgame 
435 
above; like Aronson, the prize-winning scientist who had worked at the 
Pasteur Institute and knew Lewis at Penn, Shope considered Lewis the 
smartest person he ever met. 
Lewis had reached some tentative conclusions in Philadelphia about 
tuberculosis. He believed that three, and possibly four, inherited factors 
affected the natural ability of guinea pigs to produce antibodies—i.e., to 
resist infection. He had planned to unravel precisely what the nature of 
these factors was. This was an important question, one that potentially 
went far beyond tuberculosis to a deep understanding of the immune 
system. 
But when he and Shope repeated the Philadelphia experiments they 
got different results. They examined every element of the experiments to 
see what might explain the differences and repeated them again. Then 
they repeated the process and the experiments again. Again they got dif-
fering results, results from which it was impossible to draw a conclusion. 
Nothing in science is as damning as the inability of an outside exper-
imenter to reproduce results. Now Lewis himself could not reproduce the 
results he had gotten in Philadelphia, results he had depended upon. 
Much less could he build upon and expand them. He had run into a wall. 
He began plugging away at it. Shope too plugged away at it. Both of 
them had the tenacity to stay after a thing. But they made no progress. 
More distressing to Smith and Flexner, who watched closely, was the 
way Lewis was approaching the problem. His failures seemed to confuse 
him. Unlike Avery, who broke his problems down into smaller ones that 
could be solved and who learned from each failure, Lewis seemed simply 
to be applying brute force, huge numbers of experiments. He sought 
to add other scientists with particular expertise to his team, but he did 
not deﬁne what precise role new people would play. Unlike Avery, who 
recruited people with speciﬁc skills to attack a speciﬁc question, Lewis 
seemed simply to want to throw resources at the problem, hoping some-
one would solve it. 
He seemed desperate now. Desperate men can be dangerous, and 
even feared, but they are rarely respected. He was losing their respect, and 
with that would go everything. 
As Lewis approached the end of his third year in Princeton, Smith 
conﬁded his disappointment to Flexner: “He is perhaps aiming higher 
than his training and equipment warrant and this results in a demand to 
"
"436 
The Great Influenza 
surround himself with technically trained chemists, etc. This is what 
Carrel”—Alexis Carrel at the Rockefeller Institute in New York, who had 
already received the Nobel Prize—“is doing but Carrel has another type 
of mind and gets results from his organization. A closely-knit group 
requires that the ideas come from the head man.” 
Nor did Lewis seem to recognize as worth pursuing potentially prom-
ising side questions his experiments raised. His explanation for his fail-
ures, for example, was that the diet of the guinea pigs was different in 
Princeton than it had been in Philadelphia. This was potentially signiﬁ-
cant, and it was possible he was correct. The relationship between diet 
and disease had been noted before but chieﬂy in terms of outright diet 
deﬁciencies that directly caused such diseases as scurvy and pellagra. 
Lewis was thinking about far more subtle and indirect linkages between 
diet and disease, including infectious disease. But instead of pursuing this 
line of inquiry, Lewis continued to pound away at his old one. He did so 
without result. He reported to the Board of Scientiﬁc Directors, “I have 
planned no change in my line of work for the coming year.” 
Flexner wanted to hear something different. Lewis was making him-
self a marked man, marked in no good way. It wasn’t Lewis’s failures that 
did so; it was the manner in which he was failing—dully, without imagi-
nation, and without the gain of knowledge elsewhere. Lewis had shown 
enough, or failed to show enough, that Flexner had already made one 
judgment. When Smith retired, Lewis would not replace him. 
Flexner wrote him a chilling letter. In a draft Flexner was brutal: 
“There is no obligation expressed or implied in the Institute’s relation to 
you, or your relation to the Institute, beyond this service year period. . . .  
As the Iowa chair is still open and you are very much wanted to ﬁll it, and 
the University of Iowa would make a supreme effort to secure you, I 
believe it due you to be minutely informed just what the position the 
Board of Scientiﬁc Directors has taken with reference to you. . . . There  
was doubt expressed about your future in general.” 
Flexner did not send that letter. It was too harsh even for him. Instead 
he simply informed Lewis that the board was “unequivocally opposed to 
the appointment of one primarily a human pathologist”—which Lewis 
was—“to the directorship of the Department of Animal Pathology,” and 
that therefore he would not replace Smith. But he also warned Lewis that 
the board would not elevate him to the rank of a “member” of the insti-
"
"Endgame 
437 
tute, the equivalent of a tenured full professor. He would remain only an 
associate. His appointment expired in six months, in mid-1926, and the 
board would give him a three-year appointment into 1929. Perhaps he 
should accept the Iowa offer after all. 
In Faust, Goethe wrote,“Too old am I to be content with play, / Too young 
to live untroubled by desire.” 
Lewis was too old to play, too young to be untroubled by desire. Read-
ing Flexner’s letter had to have been a crushing blow. He had expected to 
be told he would succeed Smith. He had been certain he would be ele-
vated to the rank of “member” of the institute. From the laboratory, he 
drew his identity, and yet now the laboratory gave him not sustenance 
but cold rebuff. The two men he most admired in the world, two men he 
had thought of as scientiﬁc fathers—one of whom he regarded as almost 
a father—had judged that he lacked something, lacked a thing that would 
entitle him to join their brotherhood, to become a member. 
By now Lewis’s family had moved to Princeton, but his marriage was 
no better. Perhaps the fault lay entirely within him, within what was now 
not so much a failing ambition as a failing love. 
He declined the Iowa job once again. He had always been willing to 
gamble. Now he gambled on proving himself to Flexner and Smith. 
For the next year and a half, he worked, at ﬁrst feverishly but then . . .  
Something in him made him withdraw. His son Hobart, then fourteen 
years old, was having difﬁculties emotionally and difﬁculties in school, 
although a change of schools seemed to help. And Lewis had a car acci-
dent that broke his concentration. 
He accomplished little. Again his failures were not like those that 
Avery would confront for nearly a decade. Avery was attacking the most 
fundamental questions of immunology and, ultimately, genetics. From 
each failed experiment he learned, perhaps not much but something. 
And what he was learning went beyond how to ﬁne-tune an experiment. 
What he was learning from his failures had large ramiﬁcations that 
applied to entire ﬁelds of knowledge. One could argue that none of 
Avery’s experiments failed. 
Lewis was simply foundering. He had spent hour after hour in the 
laboratory. It had always been his favorite place, his place of rest, of peace. 
It gave him no peace now. He began to avoid it. His marriage was no bet-
"
"438 
The Great Influenza 
ter; his wife and he barely communicated. But he found other things to 
do, gardening, carpentry, things he had never attended to before. Perhaps 
he hoped getting away would clear his mind, allow him to see through 
the fog of data. Perhaps he thought that. But his mind never seemed to go 
back to the problem. 
In August 1927, he confessed to Flexner, “I feel I have not been very 
productive—certainly I feel that I have had a meager return for a lot of 
hard work—but some way everything I have touched in the hope it 
would go faster than the very slow jobs I have been on for so long has 
either been a wash-out or turned into some other big [problem].” 
Then he said something even more striking. He was no longer going 
to the laboratory: “I am spending most of my time on an old house and 
garden I have gotten hold of.” 
Flexner replied, for him, gently. Lewis was now more than a year into 
his three-year contract extension. Flexner warned that his tuberculosis 
work “has been under way as your major problem for four years. The 
outcome, even if continued many years longer, is uncertain and the yield 
of side issues, often the most fruitful of all, has been small. I do not 
believe in sticking to a rather barren subject. One of the requisites of an 
investigator is a kind of instinct which tells him quite as deﬁnitely when 
to drop, as well as when to take up a subject. Your time can be more 
promisingly employed along another major line.” 
Lewis rejected the advice. 
On September 30, 1918, J. S. Koen, a veterinarian with the federal Bureau 
of Animal Industry, had been attending the National Swine Breeders 
Show in Cedar Rapids. Many of the swine were ill, some of them deathly 
ill. Over the next several weeks he tracked the spread of the disease, the 
deaths of thousands of swine, and concluded they had inﬂuenza—the 
same disease killing humans. Farmers attacked his diagnosis; it could cost 
them money. Nonetheless, a few months later he published his conclu-
sion in the Journal of Veterinary Medicine: “Last fall and winter we were 
confronted with a new condition, if not a new disease. I believe I have as 
much to support this diagnosis in pigs as the physicians have to support 
a similar diagnosis in man. The similarity of the epidemic among people 
and the epidemic among pigs was so close, the reports so frequent, that 
an outbreak in the family would be followed immediately by an outbreak 
"
"Endgame 
439 
among the hogs, and vice versa, as to present a most striking coincidence 
if not suggesting a close relation between the two conditions.” 
The disease had continued to strike swine in the Midwest. In 1922 and 
1923, veterinarians at the Bureau of Animal Industry transmitted the dis-
ease from pig to pig through mucus from the respiratory tract. They ﬁl-
tered the mucus and tried to transmit the disease with the ﬁltrate. They 
failed. 
Shope observed swine inﬂuenza during a trip home to Iowa. He 
began investigating it. Lewis helped him isolate a bacillus virtually iden-
tical to B. inﬂuenzae and named it B. inﬂuenzae suis. Shope also replicated 
the experiments by the veterinarians and began to move beyond them. 
He found this work potentially very interesting. 
Lewis’s own work, however, continued to founder. Flexner and Smith had 
kept their assessments of it conﬁdential. As far as the rest of the world— 
even including Shope—knew, they held him in the highest regard. In 
June 1928, for the fourth time, the University of Iowa made Lewis still 
another offer, an outstanding offer. Flexner urged him to accept. Lewis 
replied that his “compelling” interest remained at Princeton. 
Flexner called Smith to discuss “our future Lewis problem.” They 
could not understand him. Lewis had produced nothing in ﬁve years. 
They in fact did have the highest regard for him—just no longer for his 
laboratory skills. Flexner still believed that Lewis had true gifts, broad 
and deep vision, an extraordinary ability to communicate and inspire. 
Flexner still believed that Lewis could become a dominant ﬁgure in med-
ical teaching and research. Of that ﬁeld, he could still be master. 
Lewis had shown at least some of what Welch had. Perhaps he had 
much of it. And perhaps in the end he also lacked what Welch lacked, the 
creativity and organizational vision to actually run a major laboratory 
investigation. 
Two days after Flexner and Smith talked, Flexner sat down with 
Lewis. He was blunt. But he assured Lewis the bluntness “was a conclu-
sion placed before [you] in all kindness.” The prospect of Lewis’s becom-
ing a member of the institute was a distant dream. His research had been 
“sterile” for the past ﬁve years. Unless it yielded something solid and 
important in the next year, he would not be reappointed even to a tem-
porary position. He was approaching ﬁfty years of age and Flexner told 
"
"440 
The Great Influenza 
him, “The chances of [your] changing in the direction of more fertile 
ideas [are] small.” He also said Lewis had not acted with “energy and 
determination.” He had not fought. Then, most painfully, Flexner said he 
was “not essentially of the investigator type.” 
Flexner urged him—indeed, all but ordered him—to take the Iowa 
position. It was an extraordinary offer: $10,000 a year salary—more than 
double the median income for physicians—and a free hand in organizing 
a department. Flexner assured him that he still believed he had great gifts. 
Great gifts. He could still make a huge contribution, a signiﬁcant and 
important contribution. At Iowa he could become a major ﬁgure, inspire 
respect, and be far happier. 
Lewis listened quietly and said little. He did not remonstrate or argue. 
He was almost passive, yet ﬁrm. There was a cold, unreachable center 
within him. Regarding Iowa, that was settled. He would reject the offer. 
He had no interest in anything but the laboratory. He hoped in the next 
year to justify reappointment. 
After the conversation Flexner was frustrated, frustrated and angry. “I 
put all the pressure I could upon him but without avail,” he wrote Smith. 
“My notion is our obligations to Lewis are now fulﬁlled and that unless a 
great change takes place it will be our duty to act decisively next spring. He 
has been a real disappointment to me. . . . I  left no doubt as to the risk he 
takes, and he left me no doubt that he understands and accepts that risk.” 
A few months before Flexner’s brutal conversation with Lewis, Hideyo 
Noguchi had gone to Ghana to investigate yellow fever. Noguchi was as 
close to a pet as Flexner had. They had ﬁrst met almost thirty years ear-
lier, when Flexner was still at Penn and gave a speech in Tokyo. Uninvited, 
Noguchi had followed him to Philadelphia, knocked on his door, and 
announced he had come to work with him. Flexner found a position for 
him, then took him to the Rockefeller Institute. There Noguchi had 
developed an international reputation, but a controversial one. 
He had done real science with Flexner, for example, identifying—and 
naming—neurotoxin in cobra venom. And he had claimed even more 
signiﬁcant breakthroughs on his own, including the ability to grow polio 
and rabies viruses. (He could not have grown them with his techniques.) 
Rivers, also at Rockefeller and the ﬁrst person to demonstrate that viruses 
were parasites on living cells, questioned those claims. Noguchi responded 
"
"Endgame 
441 
by telling him that a man who had done research for a long time had 
scars that he could never get rid of. Later Rivers discovered a signiﬁcant 
unrelated mistake in his own work and confessed to Noguchi that he 
planned to retract his paper. Noguchi advised against it, saying it would 
take ﬁfteen years for anyone else to ﬁnd out he was wrong. Rivers was 
astounded, later saying, “I don’t think Noguchi was honest.” 
Noguchi’s most important claim, however, was to have isolated the 
pathogen that caused yellow fever. It was a spirochete, he said, a spiral-
shaped bacterium. Years before, Walter Reed had seemed to prove that a 
ﬁlterable virus caused the disease. Reed was long dead, but others 
attacked Noguchi’s ﬁndings. In response to one such attack, Noguchi 
wrote Flexner, “[H]is objections were very unreasonable. . . . I am not  
certain whether these Havana men are really interested in scientiﬁc dis-
cussion or not.” 
Noguchi did not lack courage. And so he went to Ghana to prove 
himself correct. 
In May 1928 he died there, of yellow fever. 
Noguchi’s death came one month before Flexner and Lewis had their 
conversation. It attracted international attention, made the front pages of 
newspapers around the world, inspired glowing tributes in all the New 
York papers. For Noguchi, it was a Viking funeral, a blazing glory that 
obliterated all questions about the quality of his science. 
The entire Rockefeller Institute reeled from the loss. Despite any sci-
entiﬁc controversies, Noguchi had been buoyant, enthusiastic, always 
helpful, universally liked. Both Flexner and Lewis suffered in particular. 
Noguchi had been, literally, like a son to Flexner. Lewis had known him 
well, very well, going back to his ﬁrst happy days in New York. 
Noguchi’s death also left open the question of whether he had in fact 
isolated the pathogen that caused yellow fever. The institute wanted that 
question answered. 
Shope volunteered to do it. He was young and believed himself invul-
nerable. He wanted action. He wanted to investigate yellow fever. 
Flexner refused to allow him to go. Shope was also only twenty-eight 
years old, with a wife and an infant son. It was too dangerous. 
Then Lewis volunteered. The scientiﬁc question remained, and it was 
a major one. Who was more qualiﬁed to investigate it than he? He had 
proven himself expert at cultivating bacteria and, even more important, 
"
"442 
The Great Influenza 
he had proven that polio was a viral disease. Noguchi notwithstanding, it 
seemed a virus did cause yellow fever. And, important as the question 
was, it also had built-in limits; it was the kind of narrow and focused sci-
ence that Flexner still had faith in Lewis to answer. 
Lewis’s wife, Louise, objected. The laboratory had taken him away 
from her and their two children enough. She was already furious at him 
for once again declining the Iowa position. But this . . . this was some-
thing else. 
Lewis had never listened to her. They had not had a real marriage for 
a long time. For him, this solved every problem. If he succeeded, he 
would restore himself in Flexner’s eyes. Five years before he had resigned 
from the Phipps Institute and simultaneously withdrawn his acceptance 
of the Iowa offer without any other prospects. All that he had done in 
order to do the one thing he loved, return to the laboratory. He was will-
ing to gamble again. He was energized again. And he was more desperate 
than ever. 
Instead of Ghana, however, he would go to Brazil. A particularly viru-
lent strain of yellow fever had surfaced there. 
In late November 1928, Flexner came to Princeton to see Lewis off. 
Flexner’s attitude toward him had already seemed to change. He was will-
ing again to talk about the future. He also wanted, he said, to “learn about 
Shope’s Iowa work.” Shope had recently observed an extraordinarily vio-
lent inﬂuenza epizootic—an epidemic in animals—in swine. The overall 
mortality of the entire local pig population had reached 4 percent; in 
some herds mortality had exceeded 10 percent. That very much sounded 
like the inﬂuenza pandemic in humans a decade earlier. 
A month later Lewis sailed for Brazil. On January 12, 1929, Frederick 
Russell, the colonel who had organized much of the army’s scientiﬁc 
work for Gorgas and who now worked for a Rockefeller-sponsored inter-
national health organization, received a cable saying Lewis had arrived 
and was well. The institute relayed the news to his wife, who had been so 
angry at Lewis’s departure that she had wanted nothing to do with the 
Rockefeller Institute and returned to Milwaukee, where both she and 
Lewis had grown up. Each week Russell was to receive news of Lewis and 
send it on to her. 
"
"Endgame 
443 
Lewis located his laboratory in Belem, a port city on the Para River, 
seventy-two miles from the ocean but the main port of entry into the 
Amazon Basin. Europeans settled there in 1615, and a rubber boom in 
the nineteenth century had ﬁlled the city with Europeans while Indians 
went back and forth into the interior in dugout canoes. It was steamy, 
equatorial, and received as much precipitation as any area in the world. 
On February 1, Lewis wrote Flexner, “Arrived here on Tuesday and 
went  right  to  work. . . .  [H]ave been setting up my own shop here, await-
ing materials, having additional screening prepared, etc. . . .  Should be 
started at something by early next week I hope.” 
He seemed the old Lewis, energetic and conﬁdent. And each week 
Russell received a two-word wire: “Lewis well.” He received them through 
February, March, April, and May. But if Lewis was well, he sent no word 
about his research; he gave no sign that work was going well. 
Then, on June 29, Russell sent a note hand-delivered by messenger to 
Flexner: “The following message from Rio de Janeiro, regarding Dr. Paul 
Lewis, was sent to me today, with the request that it be delivered to you. 
‘Lewis’s illness began on June 25th. Doctors state it to be yellow fever. 
Condition of June 28th, temperature 103.8, pulse 80. . . .’  The Founda-
tion is sending the message to Dr. Theobald Smith and also to Mrs. Lewis 
at Milwaukee.” 
Even as Russell sent that note to Flexner, Lewis was in agony. He had 
vomited violently, the nearly black vomit of the severe cases; the virus 
attacked the mucosa in his stomach, which bled, giving the vomit the 
dark color; it attacked the bone marrow, causing violent aching. An 
intense, searing headache gave him no rest, except perhaps when he was 
delirious. He had seizures. His colleagues packed him in ice and tried to 
keep him hydrated but there was little else they could do. 
The next day another wire came: “Lewis condition critical. Anuria 
supervened Saturday.” 
His kidneys were failing and he was producing no urine. All the tox-
ins that the body normally rid itself of were now building up in his sys-
tem. Later that same day, Russell received a second wire: “Lewis on fourth 
day of illness. Marked renal involvement.” He was becoming jaundiced, 
taking on the classic color that gave the disease its name. Symptom by 
symptom, step by step his body was failing. 
"
"444 
The Great Influenza 
June 30, 1929, was a Sunday. All day Lewis suffered, writhed in delir-
ium. He went into a coma. It was his only relief. It was the ﬁfth day of his 
illness. There would not be a sixth. 
Shortly before midnight Dr. Paul A. Lewis found release. 
An unsigned wire to Russell reported, “Typical yellow fever. Probably 
laboratory infection. Wire instructions regarding body.” 
Shope walked down Maple Street on the edge of the Princeton cam-
pus to inform Lewis’s wife, who had come back from Milwaukee, and son 
Hobart, now a college student who had remained in Princeton. 
Lewis’s widow gave simple and explicit instructions. She was return-
ing immediately to Milwaukee and wanted the body shipped directly 
there, where those who cared about Paul were. She speciﬁcally stated that 
she wanted no memorial service held at the Rockefeller Institute, in 
either New York or Princeton. 
There was none. 
Shope accompanied the body to Wisconsin. The business manager of the 
Rockefeller Institute asked him, “I wonder if you could arrange when you 
arrive to order some ﬂowers for the service for Dr. Lewis.” 
The ﬂowers came, with a card signed “the Board of Scientiﬁc Direc-
tors of the Rockefeller Institute.” 
Lewis’s daughter, Janet, wrote the thank you note, addressing it “Dear 
Sirs.” Her mother could not bring herself to have any contact with the 
institute, particularly a thank you note. The institute paid Lewis’s salary to 
her through June 1930 and also paid his son Hobart’s college tuition. 
(Like his grandfather and aunt Marian, the ﬁrst woman to graduate from 
Rush Medical College in Chicago, he became a physician—but a clini-
cian, not a scientist.) 
In the next report to the Board of Scientiﬁc Directors of the Rocke-
feller Institute—a board which now included Eugene Opie, whom Lewis 
had recruited as his successor at Phipps—Flexner noted that one scien-
tist’s resignation “which is much regretted, left the study of light phe-
nomena unprovided for.” 
Lewis had originally suggested that work to Flexner. Flexner men-
tioned a “recrudescence of poliomyelitis.” Lewis had proved that a ﬁlter-
able virus caused that disease. 
Flexner went through item after item concerning the institute. He 
"
"Endgame 
445 
pointed out “a pressing problem was the one in connection with the still 
unﬁnished work of Dr. Noguchi.” He made no mention of Paul A. Lewis, 
no mention of Dr. Lewis at all. 
Later Flexner received Lewis’s autopsy report and news that researchers 
at the institute in New York had succeeded in transmitting Lewis’s 
virus—they called it “P.A.L.”—to monkeys and were continuing experi-
ments with it. Flexner wrote in reply, “Thank you for sending me the 
report on the comparison of the Rivas and P.A.L. strains of yellow fever 
virus. At your convenience I should like to talk over the report with you. 
Dr. Cole thinks white paint and some other improvements desirable in 
your animal quarters. Has he spoken with you about them?” 
Lewis had worked with deadly pathogens his entire adult life and had 
never infected himself. Since Noguchi’s death everyone working with yel-
low fever took special care. 
In the ﬁve months Lewis worked in Brazil he did not report any 
details of his research and his laboratory notes provided almost no infor-
mation about it. He died from a laboratory accident. Somehow he gave 
yellow fever to himself. 
Shope later told his sons a rumor that Lewis, who smoked often, had 
somehow contaminated a cigarette with the virus and smoked it. The 
virus entered the bloodstream through a cut on his lip. David Lewis 
Anderson recalls that his father, Lewis’s friend in Philadelphia, also 
blamed cigarettes for Lewis’s death. 
Three years earlier Sinclair Lewis, no relation, won the Pultizer Prize 
for his bestselling novel Arrowsmith, a novel about a young scientist at a 
ﬁctionalized version of the Rockefeller Institute. Everyone in medical sci-
ence, especially at the institute, knew that novel. In it the main character’s 
wife dies from smoking a cigarette contaminated by a deadly pathogen. 
Flexner wrote an obituary of Lewis for Science in which he referred to 
“the important observations made by him in association with Sewall 
Wright on the hereditary factors in research in tuberculosis.” Lewis’s 
work with Wright had been carried out in Philadelphia; Flexner made no 
mention of anything Lewis had done in the ﬁve years since his return to 
the institute. 
Meanwhile, Shope returned to Iowa to explore further this swine 
inﬂuenza, to observe still another epidemic among pigs. 
"

In 1931, two years after Lewis’s death, Shope published three papers in a 
single issue of the Journal of Experimental Medicine. His work appeared 
in good company. In that same issue were articles by Avery, one of the 
series on the pneumococcus that would lead to his discovery of the trans-
forming principle; by Thomas Rivers, the brilliant virologist; and by Karl 
Landsteiner, who had just won the Nobel Prize. All of these scientists 
were at the Rockefeller Institute. 
Each of Shope’s articles was about inﬂuenza. He listed Lewis as the 
lead author on one. He had found the cause of inﬂuenza, at least in swine. 
It was a virus. We now know that the virus he found in swine descended 
directly from the 1918 virus, the virus that made all the world a killing 
zone. It is still unclear whether humans gave the virus to swine, or swine 
gave it to humans, although the former seems more likely. 
By then the virus had mutated into mild form, or the swine’s immune 
systems had adjusted to it, or both, since the virus alone seemed to cause 
only mild disease. Shope did demonstrate that with B. inﬂuenzae as a sec-
ondary invader it could still be highly lethal. Later he would show that 
antibodies from human survivors of the 1918 pandemic protected pigs 
against this swine inﬂuenza. 
Shope’s work was momentous and provocative. As soon as his arti-
cles appeared, a British scientist named C. H. Andrewes contacted him. 
Andrewes and several colleagues had been expending all their efforts on 
inﬂuenza, and they found Shope’s articles compelling. Andrewes and 
Shope became close friends; Shope even took him hunting and ﬁshing 
where he had vacationed since he was six years old, at Woman Lake, Min-
nesota. 
In England in 1933, during a minor outbreak of human inﬂuenza, 
Andrewes, Patrick Laidlaw, and Wilson Smith, largely following Shope’s 
methodology, ﬁltered fresh human material and transmitted inﬂuenza to 
ferrets. They found the human pathogen. It was a ﬁlter-passing organ-
ism, a virus, like Shope’s swine inﬂuenza. 
Had Lewis lived, he would have coauthored the papers with Shope, 
and even added breadth and experience to them. He would have helped 
produce another of the seminal papers in virology. His reputation would 
have been secure. Shope was not perfect. For all his later accomplishments 
in inﬂuenza and in other areas, some of his ideas, including some of those 
"
"Endgame 
447 
pertaining to inﬂuenza, were mistaken. Lewis, if energized and once again 
painstaking, might have prevented those errors. But no matter. 
Shope was soon made a member of Rockefeller Institute. Lewis would 
likely have also been made a member. He would have been invited into 
the inner sanctum. He would have had all that he wanted. He would have 
belonged to the community of those who do science. One could consider 
Lewis, in a way most personal to him, the last victim of the 1918 pan-
demic. 
"
"I
A F T E RWO R D  
started this book intending to explore not only the 1918 pan-
demic itself, but also several questions that did not involve inﬂuenza 
per se. One involved how the larger society reacted to an immense chal-
lenge. Another confronts anyone making a decision: What process do you 
follow to collect information that most likely leads to a good one? In 
short, how do you know when you know? 
More narrowly, I also wanted to explore how an investigator should 
do science, even under the most stressful conditions. William Park, 
Oswald Avery, and Paul Lewis speak especially to this last point. They 
were very different people. Each approached science in his own way. 
Park saw it as a means to a larger end. To him, a man who almost 
became a medical missionary, it was a tool to relieve suffering. Disci-
plined and methodical, he was interested chieﬂy in immediate results 
useful for that purpose. His contributions, particularly those made with 
Anna Williams, were enormous; their improvement of diphtheria anti-
toxin alone doubtless saved hundreds of thousands of lives over the past 
century. But his purpose also limited him, and limited the kind of ﬁnd-
ings he and those under him would make. 
Avery was driving and obsessive. Part artist and part hunter, he had 
vision, patience, and persistence. His artist’s eye let him see a landscape 
from a new perspective and in exquisite detail, the hunter in him told 
him when something no matter how seemingly trivial was out of place, 
"
"Afterword 
449 
and he wondered. The wonder moved him to sacriﬁce all else. He had no 
choice but to pursue it. Cutting a Gordian knot gave him no satisfaction. 
He wanted to unfold and understand such things, not destroy them. So 
he tugged at a thread and kept tugging, untangling it, following where it 
led, until he had unraveled an entire fabric. Then others wove a new fab-
ric for a different world. T. S. Eliot said any new work of art alters slightly 
the existing order. Avery accomplished more than that. 
Paul Lewis was a romantic, and a lover. He wanted. He wanted more 
and loved more passionately than Park or Avery. But like many roman-
tics, it was the idea of the thing as much or more than the thing itself that 
he loved. He loved science, and he loved the laboratory. But it did not 
yield to him. The deepest secrets of the laboratory showed themselves to 
Lewis when he was guided by others, when others opened a crack for 
him, but that crack closed. When he came alone the laboratory presented 
a stone face, unyielding to his pleadings. He could not ﬁnd the key, the 
way to ask the question. Of the three, only he could not penetrate it. And, 
whether his death was a suicide or a true accident, it killed him. 
But one cannot leave this subject without speaking to other questions: 
the likelihood and potential danger of another inﬂuenza pandemic, what 
we can learn from the one of 1918–1919, and how we can apply those les-
sons to the emergence of a new pathogen, whether that pathogen is a 
weapon of terror or a new natural menace—such as Severe Acute Respi-
ratory Syndrome, SARS, the disease which spread from animals to man 
in the spring of 2003 and threatened to become a major pandemic. 
The answer to the ﬁrst question—the likelihood and potential danger 
of another inﬂuenza pandemic—is not reassuring. Every expert on 
inﬂuenza agrees that the ability of the inﬂuenza virus to reassort genes 
means that another pandemic not only can happen. It almost certainly 
will happen. 
For inﬂuenza is not like SARS, which was contained and—as this 
book goes to press—may have been completely eliminated. SARS, 
although more lethal even than the 1918 inﬂuenza virus, is less danger-
ous for several reasons. 
First, SARS requires fairly close contact to spread, while inﬂuenza is 
among the most contagious of all diseases. Also, in SARS, the virus reaches 
maximum concentration in the upper respiratory tract, where coughs 
"
"450 
The Great Influenza 
and sneezes are most likely to spread the virus, a week or longer after 
symptoms develop. This gives public health ofﬁcials time to ﬁnd, identify, 
and isolate cases. By contrast, the inﬂuenza virus can spread from person 
to person before any symptoms develop, before a victim knows he or she 
is sick. 
If a new inﬂuenza virus does emerge, given modern travel patterns it 
will likely spread even more rapidly than it did in 1918. It will infect at 
least several hundred million, and probably more than a billion, people. 
In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 
a new pandemic would make between 40 and 100 million people sick. So 
the prospect is threatening indeed. 
If one compares the 1918–1919 pandemic to AIDS, one sees how 
threatening. 
Today the world population exceeds 6 billion. Worldwide, in the twenty-
four years since AIDS emerged as a disease, the total death toll is esti-
mated at 24,800,000; at this writing, an estimated 42 million people are 
currently infected with the HIV virus. In the United States the cumula-
tive death toll from AIDS is 467,910 people. 
In 1918 the world’s population was 1.8 billion, less than one-third 
today’s. Yet the 1918 inﬂuenza virus killed a likely 50 million and possibly 
as many as 100 million. The AIDS deaths occurred over twenty-four 
years; most of the inﬂuenza deaths occurred in less than twenty-four 
weeks. 
There are now drugs that can contain the HIV virus; the difﬁculty lies 
in getting those drugs to the poorest parts of the world as well as in edu-
cating people there and in countries, such as China, that continue to 
minimize the disease. In the United States, those drugs limited AIDS 
deaths to 8,998 people in the most recent year for which statistics are 
available. 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the 
annual death toll in the United States from inﬂuenza now averages 
36,000 in a nonepidemic year. The 1918 virus killed 675,000 people in the 
United States, out of a population not much more than one-third the size 
of today’s. 
In 1999 the Centers for Disease Control produced a study of what 
would likely happen if a new pandemic virus struck the United States. It 
took into account modern medical advances. 
"

451 
Antibiotics would of course signiﬁcantly cut 1918’s mortality rate for 
secondary bacterial infections following inﬂuenza. And several antiviral 
drugs have demonstrated some effectiveness against inﬂuenza. Amanta-
dine and its more recent derivative, rimantadine, block the ability of the 
virus to build an ion channel between itself and the cell—in effect a tun-
nel into the cell—it attaches to. When these drugs work, the virus cannot 
get inside the cell, cannot invade it. 
Two other drugs, zanamivir (Relenza), which is inhaled, and oseltamivir 
(Tamiﬂu), a pill, take a different approach. Both bind to the viral neu-
raminidase, so when new viruses try to escape the dead cell they get 
trapped on the cell surface as if on ﬂy paper. They can’t infect other cells. 
(See the discussion of neuraminidase on page 104.) 
All these drugs can reduce the severity and duration of an attack, but 
only if taken within forty-eight hours after symptoms appear. Taken pro-
phylactically the drugs can also prevent an attack, although the preventative 
effect does not last long and at this writing the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has approved only oseltamivir for this purpose. The virus has also 
shown some ability to develop resistance to them. So, although antiviral 
drugs do show progress and promise, they are not an answer. 
A vaccine offers far better protection, especially for the elderly. But to 
make the vaccine, investigators have to aim at a moving target. Every year 
they try to predict which virus strains will dominate and the direction of 
antigen drift. Then they design a vaccine for these antigens. When the 
investigators are right, when they hit their target, the vaccine protects 
very well for an entire ﬂu season, preventing many attacks and reducing 
the severity of others. But the vaccine needs to be produced in huge 
quantities, which takes months, and in that time the virus can mutate in 
a direction different from the one anticipated. And even if the vaccine 
includes the right antigens, given the “mutant swarm” nature of the virus, 
some viral strains will escape it. Vaccines using killed viruses are injected, 
but in 2003 a new vaccine (FluMist) was introduced that uses live virus 
and is inhaled. 
The real danger, though, is that it may not be possible to develop and 
distribute a vaccine in time to protect against a new virus. Inﬂuenza viruses 
for vaccines are grown in chicken eggs. When scientists tried to prepare a 
vaccine to the H5N1 Hong Kong virus of 1997, the virus initially proved 
too lethal: the virus killed the eggs in which it was being grown. Ulti-
"
"452 
The Great Influenza 
mately the problem was solved, but developing this vaccine took more 
than a year. If another lethal virus jumps to humans and it takes that long 
to develop a vaccine, by then the virus will have done its damage. 
So even with all the medical advances since 1918, the CDC estimates 
that if a new pandemic virus strikes, then the U.S. death toll will most 
likely fall between 89,000 and 300,000. It also estimates a best case sce-
nario of 75,000 deaths and a worst case scenario in which 422,000 Amer-
icans would die. 
The CDC based that range, however, on different estimates of the 
effectiveness and availability of a vaccine and of the age groups most vul-
nerable to the virus. It did not factor in the most important determinant 
of deaths: the lethality of the virus itself. The CDC simply ﬁgured viru-
lence by computing an average from the last three pandemics, those in 
1918, 1957, and 1968. Yet two of those three real pandemics fall outside 
the range of the statistical model. The 1968 pandemic was less lethal than 
the best case scenario, and the 1918 pandemic was more lethal than the 
worst case scenario. After adjusting for population growth, the 1918 virus 
killed four times as many as the CDC’s worst case scenario, and medical 
advances cannot now signiﬁcantly mitigate the killing impact of a virus 
that lethal. 
If a new pandemic struck, people suffering from ARDS would quickly 
overwhelm intensive care units; those with ARDS who did not get true 
intensive care would have a mortality rate approaching that in 1918. A 
new virus would also feast on a population that did not exist in 1918— 
those with compromised immune systems, including people undergoing 
radiation or chemotherapy for cancer and transplant recipients, not to 
mention anyone with HIV. 
No one has attempted to estimate the worldwide death toll of another 
inﬂuenza pandemic, but one could easily imagine a lethal virus—even 
one less virulent than that of 1918—killing tens of millions. No disease, 
including AIDS, poses the long-term threat of a violent explosion that 
inﬂuenza does. 
Investigators and public health ofﬁcials are not simply sitting back wait-
ing for the next pandemic. In 1948 the World Health Organization estab-
lished a formal monitoring system for inﬂuenza viruses. Currently 110 
laboratories in eighty-two countries participate. Four collaborating WHO 
"
"Afterword 
453 
inﬂuenza centers—the CDC in Atlanta and laboratories in London, 
Tokyo, and Melbourne—provide detailed analysis. 
The surveillance has two purposes: ﬁrst, to track mutations of existing 
viruses to adjust each year’s vaccine, and second, to search for any sign of 
the emergence of a new strain—a strain that might cause another pan-
demic. To know where to look matters. Therefore it matters where the 
1918 virus crossed into man. 
This book hypothesizes that the 1918 virus emerged in rural Kansas. 
There are, however, other theories. Since inﬂuenza is an endemic disease, 
not simply an epidemic one, and since investigators at that time lacked 
modern technology’s ability to distinguish one inﬂuenza virus from 
another, the only real evidence is epidemiologic. Therefore it is impos-
sible to state with absolute certainty which theory, if any of them, is 
correct. 
Some medical historians and epidemiologists have hypothesized that 
the 1918 pandemic began in China. Most pandemics whose origin is 
known did begin in Asia or Russia. There is no scientiﬁc reason for this; 
it is only a question of probabilities. There large numbers of people live 
in close contact with pigs and birds, so more opportunities exist for a 
virus to cross over from animals to humans. 
British scientist J. S. Oxford believes the 1918 pandemic originated in 
a British army post in France, where a disease British physicians called 
“purulent bronchitis” erupted in 1916. Autopsy reports of soldiers killed 
by this outbreak—today we would classify the deaths as ARDS—do bear 
a striking resemblance to those killed by inﬂuenza in 1918. 
But these alternative hypotheses have problems. After the 1918–1919 
pandemic, many scientists searched for the source of the disease. The 
American Medical Association sponsored what is generally considered 
the best of several comprehensive international studies of the pandemic, 
conducted by Dr. Edwin Jordan, editor of the Journal of Infectious Dis-
ease. He spent years reviewing evidence from all over the world and the 
AMA published his work in 1927. 
Jordan ﬁrst considered China as the possible source. Inﬂuenza did 
surface in early 1918 in China, but the outbreaks seemed minor and did 
not spread. Chinese scientists, trained by the Rockefeller Institute, them-
selves believed there was no evidence connecting any outbreak to the 
pandemic. Hong Kong had only twenty-two inﬂuenza hospital admis-

The Great Influenza 
sions in the ﬁrst ﬁve months of 1918, and in Canton the ﬁrst case of 
inﬂuenza did not surface until June 4. Recently some medical historians 
have suggested that one particular outbreak of deadly pulmonary disease 
in China in 1918 was actually inﬂuenza, but contemporary scientists 
diagnosed it as pneumonic plague and by 1918 the plague bacillus could 
be easily and conclusively identiﬁed in the laboratory. Also, one could not 
confuse pneumonic plague, with its then nearly 100 percent mortality 
rate, with even the most lethal inﬂuenza. So after tracing all known out-
breaks in China, Jordan concluded that none of them “could be reason-
ably regarded as the true forerunner of the European epidemic.” 
Jordan also considered Oxford’s hypothesis of the 1916 “purulent 
bronchitis” as a possible source. He rejected it for several reasons. At least 
some members of the British medical corps did not consider the infec-
tion contagious. No evidence suggested that it spread rapidly or widely, 
and a new inﬂuenza virus almost always does both. In fact, the outbreak 
did not seem to spread at all. 
Also, we now know a sudden mutation in an existing inﬂuenza virus 
can account for a sudden virulent outbreak. In the summer of 2002, for 
example, an inﬂuenza epidemic with an extremely high death rate 
erupted in parts of Madagascar and in some towns it sickened an out-
right majority—in one instance 67 percent—of the population. But the 
virus causing this lethal epidemic was an old one that normally caused 
mild disease. (Technically, it was an H3N2 virus of a subtype isolated in 
1999 in Panama.) It had simply mutated in a violent direction, then 
reverted to its normal mild status. The epidemic did not even spread to 
the whole island before fading away; it affected only thirteen of 111 
health districts in Madagascar. Something similar may have happened in 
the British base. 
Jordan also considered as possible sources other eruptions of inﬂuenza 
in early 1918 in France as well as some in India. He concluded that it was 
highly unlikely that the pandemic began in any of them. They too 
behaved like local eruptions of endemic inﬂuenza. 
That left the United States. Jordan looked at a series of spring out-
breaks there. The evidence seemed far stronger. One could see inﬂuenza 
jumping from army camp to camp, then into cities, and traveling with 
troops to Europe. His conclusion: the United States was the site of origin. 
"
"Afterword 
455 
A later, equally comprehensive, multivolume British study of the pan-
demic agreed with Jordan. It too found no evidence for the inﬂuenza’s 
origin in the Orient; it too rejected the 1916 outbreak of “purulent bron-
chitis” among British troops; and it too concluded, “The disease was 
probably carried from the United States to Europe.” 
Australian Macfarlane Burnet, quoted earlier on this point, also stud-
ied the pandemic closely. He too found the evidence “strongly suggestive” 
that the disease started in the United States and spread with “the arrival 
of American troops in France.” 
More evidence against the 1916 origin comes from scientists Jeffrey 
Taubenberger and Peter Palese. Taubenberger is sequencing the genome 
of the 1918 virus after extracting samples of it from Alaska and the army’s 
pathology “museum.” Based on rates of mutation of the genome, he con-
cludes that the virus emerged a few months prior to the pandemic. Peter 
Palese states, “The evidence that the virus was around before 1918 is very 
ﬂimsy. It’s much more likely from all the data I’m aware of that the virus 
developed in 1918, or no more than six months earlier.” 
If the disease did emerge a few months prior to the pandemic, and if the 
judgments of Jordan and other contemporaries were correct in thinking 
it started in the United States, then Haskell County, Kansas, seems the most 
likely origin. First, the outbreak in January and February 1918 was so 
unusual and so dangerous that even though inﬂuenza was not a reportable 
disease, Loring Miner reported it to the U.S. Public Health Service. 
Second, if the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no explana-
tion for how it arrived there. Someone infected with the virus would have 
had to travel from an infected area somewhere else while leaving 
absolutely no trace of the disease in the country through which he or she 
passed. Given the length of time people with inﬂuenza can infect others, 
without air travel it would be physically impossible for the Haskell virus 
to have come from Europe. Nor are there other known outbreaks in the 
United States where someone could have become infected and carried it 
to Haskell. This strongly suggests that a new virus did emerge in Haskell. 
And unlike the 1916 outbreak in France, which did not seem to 
spread, one can trace with perfect deﬁniteness the route of the virus from 
Haskell to the outside world. The local paper listed by name people 
exposed to the disease who traveled to Camp Funston only a few days 
"
"456 
The Great Influenza 
before the ﬁrst reported case there; others the paper did not name may 
well also have gone there. Other than Haskell, Camp Funston was the ﬁrst 
known outbreak of epidemic inﬂuenza in the United States. Several his-
tories of the pandemic have begun their story there. And, one can easily 
track the disease from Funston outward—to other cantonments, to 
Europe, and to the U.S. civilian population. 
The fact that the 1918 pandemic likely began in the United States 
makes a difference because it warns investigators where to look for a new 
virus. They must look everywhere. 
The World Health Organization tries to do just that. Its surveillance sys-
tem quickly identiﬁed a new H7N7 virus that appeared in the spring of 
2003 in European poultry farms. This virus infected eighty-three people 
and killed one, a veterinarian. To prevent it from adapting to people, 
public health authorities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany 
slaughtered nearly thirty million animals—most of them poultry but 
some swine. (The simultaneous SARS outbreak buried information on 
this occurrence in American news media.) WHO also quickly jumped on 
the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak. But the 1997 virus still survives in chick-
ens and in 2003 killed one of two people it infected. 
This same surveillance system also helped lead to the quick identiﬁca-
tion and containment of SARS, which was initially thought to be, and feared 
as, a new inﬂuenza virus. SARS offers both a historic public health success 
story and a warning. The success is obvious. Once WHO ofﬁcials learned 
of it, it brought enormous resources to bear. Investigators around the 
world collaborated—entirely unlike the French and Germans in their 
search for the causes of cholera and plague a century earlier—and quickly 
identiﬁed the virus. At the same time world and national public health 
ofﬁcials, except in China, moved rapidly and ruthlessly to quarantine and 
isolate anyone with or exposed to the disease. What once threatened to 
become a worldwide scourge was contained and may have been eliminated 
entirely. Even if it reemerges, close monitoring should keep it in check. 
But before the ﬁrst notiﬁcation of WHO, the disease existed for 
months in China. For political and commercial reasons mainland Chi-
nese authorities kept the disease secret and then initially lied about it. 
Once they did recognize the threat they moved aggressively and success-
fully to contain it, but had it been a new inﬂuenza virus, the months of 
"
"Afterword 
457 
silence would have made it impossible for public health authorities to 
have any chance either to contain the virus or develop a vaccine before a 
pandemic exploded across the world. Possibly the Chinese government— 
and other governments—learned a lesson they will not forget; possibly 
they will be both open and aggressive in the future whenever any indica-
tion of a new disease surfaces. One hopes so. 
But even if Chinese authorities do change their approach to epidemic 
disease, even if SARS taught them and other governments around the 
world the same lesson, the fact that SARS killed people for several 
months before it attracted WHO’s attention demonstrates the vulnera-
bility of the inﬂuenza surveillance system. If the 1918 virus crossed into 
humans in Haskell County, inﬂuenza can cross into man anywhere. 
Although eighty-two countries participate in WHO’s surveillance effort, 
more than one hundred do not. One Latin American physician at Tulane 
University involved in public health warns that at least as late as 1985— 
and probably later than that—the national medical school of Honduras 
taught its students that inﬂuenza was a bad cold. Those former students 
now practice medicine with that attitude. 
It takes time to manufacture and distribute vaccines, and vaccines are 
the most effective defense. Early warning can make an enormous difference. 
In the meantime the World Health Organization and individual 
countries continue to monitor inﬂuenza viruses, and continue to reﬁne 
plans on how to respond to another epidemic or pandemic. 
If one erupts, whether we want the knowledge or not, we will learn 
how good a job these planners have done. 
Finally comes the question of how to apply lessons from 1918 to a new 
pandemic, and how these lessons relate to bioterrorism. 
The use of biological weapons has a history going back at least to the 
Romans, who catapulted sick animals into enclaves of their enemies. The 
British and Americans likely used smallpox against Native Americans, 
and in 1777 British Major Robert Donkin recommended using smallpox 
against “American rebels” in a book on military strategy—but his recom-
mendation was physically removed, the pages referring to it torn out of, 
nearly every copy of his book. 
Yet in only three veriﬁed modern instances has disease been used as a 
weapon. During World War II Japan spread bubonic plague in China, 
"
"458 
The Great Influenza 
and Japanese scientists also infected prisoners of war with other pathogens 
in experiments. In 1984 in Oregon a cult infected salad bars with salmo-
nella (no deaths, 751 became ill). And in 2001 an unknown terrorist sent 
anthrax through the United States mail. 
The threat of bioterror is nonetheless real. The World Health Organi-
zation believes forty-three different infectious organisms could be used 
as weapons. It considers the three most serious infectious threats anthrax, 
plague, and smallpox. It also considers botulinum toxin, a pure poison 
that can paralyze and kill, a bioterror threat. 
All can be countered. Vaccines can prevent smallpox, anthrax, and 
plague—antibiotics also work against anthrax and plague—and anti-
toxin can neutralize botulinum. Also, neither anthrax nor botulinum toxin 
can spread from person to person. The ability to counter these weapons, 
however, does not mean their use would not cause mass terror even if 
their use was isolated. The reaction across the country to the anthrax 
attacks demonstrates that. And more than isolated use is possible. 
The WHO has studied what it called a “worst case” scenario of an attack 
with pneumonic plague, the most lethal and contagious incarnation of 
bubonic plague, on a city of 5 million, and concluded it would make 
150,000 ill and kill 36,000. Adjusted for population, these numbers rep-
resent considerably less than what inﬂuenza did to Philadelphia in 1918. 
The 1918 pandemic, then, provides a case study of the public health 
and government response to a major bioterrorism attack, and it teaches 
two main lessons. The ﬁrst involves threat assessment, planning, and al-
locating resources. It applies to both epidemics and large-scale bioterror 
attacks. 
In 1999 the CDC issued a formal call for each of the ﬁfty states to pre-
pare plans for pandemic inﬂuenza and laid out suggested guidelines. The 
same plans would apply to an outbreak of nearly any epidemic disease or 
use of biological weapons. Since then, and more importantly since Sep-
tember 11, 2001, most states have begun to develop plans. But clearly epi-
demiologists, scientists, public health ofﬁcials, and ethicists will have to 
join with the professionals who handle disasters to have sets of alternative 
recommendations in place—actual decisions will likely be up to elected 
ofﬁcials—and ready to implement. 
Some of the issues are obvious and simple, such as making sure health 
care workers are the ﬁrst to get vaccinated. If they become sick, they can care 
"
"Afterword 
459 
for no one else. Emergency rooms need to recognize symptoms that can 
raise red ﬂags, although the best clue will probably be a rush of cases. Inves-
tigators must be prepared to identify a pathogen, and epidemiologists 
must know the best ways to contain each likely pathogen. Legislation has 
to be in place to indemnify manufacturers and health care providers in 
the event of well-deﬁned emergency circumstances. Production facilities 
have to be ready to manufacture vaccines and drugs; others should be 
stockpiled and distributed around the country, conceivably even in a 
form that individuals can administer to themselves to lessen the strain on 
professionals. (A study published in 2003 drives home how important 
logistics can be. It warned that under existing plans to distribute antibi-
otics, a small plane spraying anthrax spores over New York City could, 
under theoretically perfect conditions, kill 120,000 people, while improv-
ing distribution of antibiotics alone would slash the death toll from an 
identical attack to 1,000.) 
Other questions also involve logistics and risk assessment. Inﬂuenza 
and most biological weapons attack the respiratory system. An outbreak 
would quickly ﬁll beds in intensive care units, so resources need to be 
available to help huge numbers of people breathe. Public health ofﬁcials 
also have to know the risks of side effects of vaccines, and based on the 
risk assessment they will have to know under what circumstances they 
would recommend vaccination and for whom. 
Some elements of any plan, however, involve questions of power and 
ethics. Public health ofﬁcials will need the authority to enforce decisions, 
including ruthless ones. If, for example, unvaccinated individuals threaten 
not only themselves but others by providing a reservoir in which path-
ogens can breed, ofﬁcials might decide to order mandatory vaccination. 
Or, if there is any chance to limit the geographical spread of the disease, 
ofﬁcials must have in place the legal power to take extreme quaran-
tine measures. A centralized system should exist to allocate all resources 
including professionals as well. The utter waste of resources in 1918 in 
New York City—when doctors repeatedly crossed each other’s paths en-
tering and leaving the same building because no centralized system was 
used to dispatch them—should not be tolerated. 
Questions about who will have the authority to make and enforce 
such decisions, and under what circumstances, must be settled in 
advance. Neither an epidemic nor an attack will leave time for debate. 
"
"460 
The Great Influenza 
Some of the issues are almost purely ethical ones. If, say, containment 
of a pathogen is possible, but doing so requires isolating a building entirely, 
possibly saving many lives but at the cost of those in that building—what 
then? Medical ethics require physicians to do their best for each individ-
ual patient, but a military commander may ethically sacriﬁce a patrol, a 
platoon, a company to save a larger group. What ethic applies? 
Another ethical question involves the free ﬂow of scientiﬁc informa-
tion. An investigator will probably at some point discover what made the 
1918 virus so lethal. The inﬂuenza virus can be created to design in the 
laboratory, so publishing the information would give it to terrorists. A 
weaponized inﬂuenza virus could be the equivalent of a worldwide 
nuclear holocaust. But publishing would also give the information to 
researchers who could ﬁnd a way to block whatever mechanism made the 
virus deadly, conceivably both countering any made-to-order killer virus 
and preventing any future natural outbreak on that scale. Should the 
information be published? 
Scientiﬁc journals have already developed voluntary guidelines on 
what to publish, but these are not simple questions. Some go to the heart 
of medical or societal ethics, others to limits on freedom. 
And some of these issues, such as stockpiling vaccines or training 
workers, simply cost enormous sums of money. (So does paying nurses 
enough to escape the current nursing shortage, which may soon 
approach that of 1918.) 
What to do depends upon the assessment of the risk. Just as there was 
disagreement over the threat from the Soviet Union during the Cold War 
and how large the defense budget had to be to handle that threat, there 
will be disagreement over how real and how severe the threat from bio-
logical weapons is and how much must be spent—in money and in the 
erosion of values—to defend against it. 
But there is another lesson from 1918 that is clear. It is also less tangi-
ble. It involves fear and the media and the way authorities deal with the 
public. 
There was terror afoot in 1918, real terror. The randomness of death 
brought that terror home. So did its speed. And so did the fact that the 
healthiest and strongest seemed the most vulnerable. 
"
"Afterword 
461 
The media and public ofﬁcials helped create that terror—not by exag-
gerating the disease but by minimizing it, by trying to reassure. 
Terror rises in the dark of the mind, in the unknown beast tracking 
us in the jungle. The fear of the dark is an almost physical manifestation 
of that. Horror movies build upon the fear of the unknown, the uncer-
tain threat that we cannot see and do not know and can ﬁnd no safe 
haven from. But in every horror movie, once the monster appears, terror 
condenses into the concrete and diminishes. Fear remains. But the edge 
of panic created by the unknown dissipates. The power of the imagina-
tion dissipates. 
In 1918 the lies of ofﬁcials and of the press never allowed the terror to 
condense into the concrete. The public could trust nothing and so they 
knew nothing. So a terror seeped into the society that prevented one 
woman from caring for her sister, that prevented volunteers from bring-
ing food to families too ill to feed themselves and who starved to death 
because of it, that prevented trained nurses from responding to the most 
urgent calls for their services. The fear, not the disease, threatened to 
break the society apart. As Victor Vaughan—a careful man, a measured 
man, a man who did not overstate to make a point—warned, “Civiliza-
tion could have disappeared within a few more weeks.” 
So the ﬁnal lesson, a simple one yet one most difﬁcult to execute, is 
that those who occupy positions of authority must lessen the panic that 
can alienate all within a society. Society cannot function if it is every man 
for himself. By deﬁnition, civilization cannot survive that. 
Those in authority must retain the public’s trust. The way to do that 
is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate 
no one. Lincoln said that ﬁrst, and best. 
Leadership must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then 
will people be able to break it apart.

his book was initially supposed to be a straightforward story of the 
deadliest epidemic in human history, told from the perspectives of 
both scientists who tried to ﬁght it and political leaders who tried to 
respond to it. I thought it would take me two and a half years to write, 
three at the most. 
That plan didn’t work. Instead this book took seven years to write. It 
has evolved (and, I hope, grown) into something rather different than 
originally conceived. 
It took so long partly because it didn’t seem possible to write about 
the scientists without exploring the nature of American medicine at this 
time, for the scientists in this book did far more than laboratory research. 
They changed the very nature of medicine in the United States. 
And, ﬁnding useful material on the epidemic proved remarkably dif-
ﬁcult. It was easy enough to ﬁnd stories of death, but my own interests 
have always focused on people who try to exercise some kind of control 
over events. Anyone doing so was far too busy, far too overwhelmed, to 
pay any attention to keeping records. 
In the course of these seven years, many people helped me. Some 
shared with me their own research or helped me ﬁnd material, others 
helped me understand the inﬂuenza virus and the disease it causes, and 
some offered advice on the manuscript. None of them, of course, is 
responsible for any errors of commission or omission, whether factual or

of judgment, in the book. (Wouldn’t it be entertaining to once read an 
acknowledgment in which the author blames others for any mistakes?) 
Two friends, Steven Rosenberg and Nicholas Restifo at the National 
Cancer Institute, helped me understand how a scientist approaches a 
problem and also read parts of the manuscript and offered comments. So 
did Peter Palese at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, one of the 
world’s leading experts on the inﬂuenza virus, who gave very generously 
of his time and expertise. Robert Webster, at St. Jude Medical Center, like 
Palese a world leader in inﬂuenza research, offered his insights and criti-
cisms as well. Ronald French checked the manuscript for accuracy on the 
clinical course of the disease. Vincent Morelli introduced me to Warren 
Summers, who along with the entire pulmonary section of the Louisiana 
State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans helped me 
understand much of what happens in the lung during an inﬂuenza 
attack; Warren was extremely patient and repeatedly helpful. Mitchell 
Freidman at the Tulane Medical School also explained events in the lung 
to me. 
Jeffrey Taubenberger at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology kept 
me abreast of his latest ﬁndings. John Yewdell at the National Institutes of 
Health also explained much about the virus. Robert Martensen at Tulane 
made valuable suggestions on the history of medicine. Alan Kraut at 
American University also read and commented on part of the manu-
script. 
I also particularly thank John MacLachlan of the Tulane-Xavier Cen-
ter for Bioenvironmental Research, who very much helped make this 
book possible. William Steinmann, head of the Center for Clinical Effec-
tiveness and Life Support at the Tulane Medical Center, gave generously 
of his ofﬁce space, knowledge of disease, and friendship. 
All of the above have M.D.s or Ph.D.s or both. Without their assis-
tance I would have been lost trying to understand my own cytokine 
storm. 
People who write books are always thanking librarians and archivists. 
They have good reason to. Virtually everyone at the Rudolph Matas Med-
ical Library at Tulane University was extraordinarily helpful to me, but 
Patsy Copeland deserves truly special mention. So do Kathleen Puglia, 
Sue Dorsey, and Cindy Goldstein.

I also want to thank Mark Samels of WGBH’s American Experience, 
who made available all the material collected for its program on the pan-
demic; Janice Goldblum at the National Academy of Sciences, who did 
more than just her job; Gretchen Worden at the Mutter Museum in 
Philadelphia; Jeffrey Anderson, then a graduate student at Rutgers, and 
Gery Gernhart, then a graduate student at American University, both of 
whom generously offered me their own research; and Charles Hardy of 
West Chester University, who gave me oral histories he had collected; and 
Mitch Yockelson at the National Archives, who gave me the beneﬁt of his 
knowledge. Eliot Kaplan, then the editor of Philadelphia Magazine, also 
supported the project. I also want to thank Pauline Miner and Catherine 
Hart in Kansas. For help with photos I want to especially thank Susan 
Robbins Watson at the American Red Cross, Lisa Pendergraff at the Dud-
ley Township Library in Kansas, Andre Sobocinski and Jan Herman at 
the Bureau of Navy Medicine, Darwin Stapleton at the Rockefeller Uni-
versity archives, and Nancy McCall at the Alan Mason Chesney archives 
at Johns Hopkins. I also want to thank Pat Ward Friedman for her infor-
mation about her grandfather. 
Now we come to my editor, Wendy Wolf. Although this is only my 
ﬁfth book, counting magazine articles I’ve worked with literally dozens of 
editors. Wendy Wolf very much stands out. She edits the old-fashioned 
way; she works at it. On this manuscript she worked particularly hard, 
and working with her has been a pleasure. It is a true statement to say 
that, for better or worse (and I hope better), this book wouldn’t exist 
without her. I’d also like to thank Hilary Redmon for her diligence, relia-
bility, and just general assistance. 
Thanks also to my agent Raphael Sagalyn, as good a professional as 
there is. I’ve had many editors but only one agent, a fact that speaks for 
itself. 
Finally I thank my brilliant wife, Margaret Anne Hudgins, who helped 
me in too many ways to enumerate, including both in concept and in the 
particular—but chieﬂy by being herself. And then there are the cousins.
